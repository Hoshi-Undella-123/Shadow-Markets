Individuals who carry the apolipoprotein E-\u03b54 (APOE4) gene are at\nheightened risk for developing late onset AD. Project 2 of the proposed P01 renewal \u201cVascular Contributions to\nDementia and Genetic Risk Factors for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\u201d will provide critical advances towards discovering\nhow changes in brain connectivity, structure and function relate to neurovascular and blood-brain barrier (BBB)\nintegrity and ultimately confer cognitive impairment in APOE4 carriers (e3/e4, e4/e4) relative to APOE3\nhomozygotes (e3/e3).\n Project 2 will follow 402 APOE4 carriers and 465 APOE3 homozygotes, initially enrolled as CU (75%)\nand MCI (25%) at baseline, who will continue to be evaluated longitudinally for changes in brain connectivity in\nrelation to neurovascular and cognitive function. Participants will continue to receive the same imaging protocol\nto enable longitudinal analyses, including 1) multi-shell DTI for white matter connectivity; 2) resting fMRI for\nfunctional connectivity; 3) structural MRI for gray matter shape, volume; and 4) DCE-MRI for BBB integrity\n(Project 1), as well as BBB/neurovascular unit (NVU) biofluid biomarkers (Core B). For preclinical AD staging,\nwe will follow the AT(N) biomarkers framework. For cognitive assessment, we will use the UDS 3.0 cognitive\ntests and supplemental tests across different cognitive domains to evaluate the relationships between\nneurovascular/BBB dysfunction and biomarkers, structural and functional connectivity, and cognitive function\nfollowing the AT(N) research framework. Participants will also complete amyloid and tau PET scans to examine\nthe effect of amyloid and tau on brain function and structure in a prespecified analysis. The role of neurovascular\nintegrity and brain connectivity in the pathophysiology of preclinical cognitive decline and clinical progression to\nmild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD have only begun to be elucidated. Using advanced neuroimaging\nmethodology, this project will apply a hypothesis-driven approach to understand how impairment in the BBB\nimpact brain structure and function and cognition in APOE4 carriers relative to APOE3 homozygotes.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY:\nExercise benefits the body in many ways. The functions of skeletal muscle, brain, liver, bone, adipose tissue\nand heart all gain from various types of physical activity and training. People suffering from disabilities, morbid\nobesity, or age-related diseases, are usually physically inactive, which exacerbates their symptoms and leads to\ndevelopment of other types of diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and some\nforms of cancers. Scientific explorations of exercise have become more molecular, focusing on the pathways\nand molecules that mediate these benefits. Irisin has been identified as an exercise-induced hormone that\nembodies many adaptations to exercise in a variety of tissues/organs, including \u201cbrowning\u201d of subcutaneous\nadipose tissue, bone remodeling, improving cognitive deficits and neuropathology, and promoting myogenesis\nof skeletal muscles.\nIn bone and fat, the effects of irisin are mediated via \u03b1v integrins, with \u03b1v\u03b25 identified as the major receptor.\nHowever, my biochemical and biophysical characterization of direct interaction between irisin and \u03b1v\u03b25\nsuggested extremely weak binding, while the concentrations of irisin that induce detectable amount of\nirisin-mediated effects in the body and in the cultured cells are really low, indicating a very high irisin/receptor\nbinding affinity. This paradox could be explained by the existence of an additional factor that facilitates\nirisin/integrin interaction and irisin-mediated integrin activation. My preliminary data suggested that an\nexercise-induced circulating protein Hsp90\u03b1 binds to integrin \u03b1v\u03b25, and functions as a cofactor to mediate the\nbinding of irisin to integrin and irisin-induced integrin signaling. Irisin is different from many integrin ligands in\nthat irisin is small, heavily glycosylated, and lacks the well-identified integrin binding motif, indicating a\nnon-canonical ways of ligand binding to integrins.\nBiophysical and biochemical approaches will be used to characterize the complexes formed by irisin (WT and\nglycosylation mutants), \u03b1v\u03b25 and Hsp90\u03b1. The molecular model will be firstly tested in HEK293T cells\nectopically expressing \u03b1v and \u03b25, and muscle and fat cells, using molecular approaches and fluorescence\nmicroscopy. The effects of Hsp90\u03b1 will be further evaluated in mice. Taken together, these studies will advance\nour understanding of irisin-mediated (or hormone-mediated, in general) integrin signaling, which will assist drug\nand antibody development to treat patients with obesity, aged-related diseases and neuro- or muscular\ndegenerative disorders.\nThe proposed project represents a great balance between biochemistry/biophysics as well as cell biology, in\nwhich I was trained during my Ph.D, and cell metabolism and animal physiology, which are the primary\ntechnologies employed by the Spiegelman lab. The resources provided by Bruce\u2019s networks, DFCI and HMS,\ntremendously facilitated my research, and will support me to become an independent scientist.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nObesity and its associated type II diabetes have reached worldwide epidemic. Exercise training is a robust means\nto increase energy expenditure and downregulate chronic inflammation, and serves as an excellent primary\nintervention to combat obesity and associated metabolic disorders. Exercise mediates an increase in the\ncirculating levels of certain hormones released from muscle that mediate certain exercise-induced adaptations\nof the body. Irisin is the first polypeptide molecule identified from the exercised muscle: irisin stimulates several\nadaptations, including the \u201cbeiging\u201d of white adipose tissue, bone remodeling, and improvement of cognition and\nmotor function in Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases. In collaboration with the Diane Mathis lab, we identified\na specific immune pathway\u2014the IL33-ST2 pathway\u2014 that is regulated by irisin to modulate adipose\ninflammation, in inguinal fat tissue (iWAT) and also in visceral fat tissue (eWAT). The molecular basis of irisin\nactions has been elaborated in my recent published work: (1) irisin collaborates with Hsp90\u03b1, another\nextracellular proteinthat activates integrin structure to allow high-affinity binding; (2) Hsp90\u03b1 itself is induced with\nexercise in mice; (3) irisin binds to a face that is distinct from the docking sites of the classical integrin ligands,\nimplying that this surface can be targeted by agonists without interfering with canonical integrin functions. My\ncurrent research plan is devised to (i) test our molecular mechanistic model in the context of adipose-immune\ncross talk (Aim 1); (ii) further dissect the downstream immune response pathways that respond to irisin action\n(Aim 2), (iii) understand how the irisin-mediated immune pathway regulates different thermogenic programs\n(Aim 2), and (iv) identify other \u201cirisin-style\u201d hormone molecules that serve a protective role in metabolic diseases\nsuch as diabetes (Aim 3), a discovery-based study planned to pave the road to my first R01. Collectively, this\nwork will contribute to fundamental knowledge of integrin biology as well as to the development of therapeutics\nfor treating metabolic disorders and beyond.\n Integrins are a large receptor family that is well known for mediating cell adhesion. Irisin is the first known\nhormone ligand that uses integrin as its receptor in a noncanonical manner, to convey pleiotropic effects - such\nas induction of IL33 expression in adipose stromal cells - that cannot be triggered by canonical integrin ligands.\nUncovering the cellular signaling pathways that are specifically activated by irisin will greatly expand our\nknowledge of integrin cellular function, and the kinases and other key players in these novel pathways will serve\nas new targets for tissue-level immune regulation and drug development. This proposal will allow me to\nundertake mechanistic studies at different levels, and from different angles. Armed with my previous training in\nbiochemistry and molecular metabolism and supported by two strong mentors in the immunometabolism field\nand six contributors that have all necessary expertise required to complete my proposed experiments, I envision\nno insurmountable obstacles in fulfilling the proposed projects and in transitioning to independence.",

    "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nExercise benefits the body in multiple ways - and irisin, one of the exercise-induced hormones from muscle,\nrecapitulates several aspects of these benefits, including the induction of heat generation from white fat tissue,\nstrengthening bones, and improving brain functions such as memory and brain-directed movements. In obese\nand diabetic mice, irisin restores the metabolic functions of fat tissue, and reduces inflammation of fat tissue\nthrough upregulation of a cytokine IL33. The proposed project is focused on understanding the molecular\ninterplay between irisin and IL33 in fat tissue and how their interaction affects different pathways in the fat cells\nresponsible for heat generation.",

Shigella virulence requires a T3SS and at least 30 secreted effectors that are often functionally redundant, yet required to invade host cells, maintain a replicative niche, minimize alarm signals, and promote colonization. We previously showed that S. flexneri T3SS activity is detected in macrophages by Caspase-1 inflammasomes, resulting in pyroptosis. In the recent mouse shigellosis model, the role of the inflammasome is only focused on gut intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). However, it is generally believed that Shigella initially infect macrophages and takes advantage of pyroptotic cell death to exit the cells and subsequently infect IECs. On the other hand, macrophage pyroptosis is known to generate pore-induced traps (PITs), trapping, and neutralizing intracellular bacterial pathogens. Since macrophages pyroptosis is considered to play dichotomous roles during Shigella infection, we propose to investigate the interaction between macrophages' inflammasomes and S. flexneri. We propose two specific Aims: In Aim1, we will investigate how pyroptotic macrophages from PITs trap intracellular bacteria. In Aim 2. We will define the role of pyroptotic macrophages and PITs during S. flexneri infection in vitro and in vivo. We hope that examining the role of macrophages pyroptosis against S. flexneri infection, will be highly significant and relevant for better understanding immunity and disease pathologies during Shigella infection and thereby providing the basis for developing novel safer, and more effective vaccines.",

    "abstract_text": "The broad long-term objective of this project is to improve the success rate of novel mood\ndisorder therapeutics by enhancing the reliability and generalizability of Clinician Reported\nOutcomes (ClinROs) in clinical trials. This will be achieved by developing and validating the\nDepression and Anxiety AI-COA\u2122, a machine learning-based drug development tool that\nanalyzes audiovisual recordings of clinical interviews to infer HAM-D and HAM-A scores, and\nthrough doing so enhances the effective reliability of primary endpoints.\nThe specific aims of this project will reduce uncertainties around the design and dimensioning of\na prospective confirmatory trial which will be proposed in the Qualification Plan (QP)\n1) Augment the pilot dataset: Assess 96 new participants to enhance the\n representativeness of the dataset, targeting 80% male and 82% non-white participants.\n Re-assess 30% of the new sample after 12 weeks to confirm sensitivity to change, and\n have each rating re-rated by two additional raters for enhanced reliability.\n2) Assess overall model performance change: Re-train the AI-COA\u2122 model with the\n augmented pilot dataset and evaluate the impact on performance. Adjust the assumed\n sample size based on the updated model's ICC to achieve the 95% CI around the\n expected ICC in the trial.\n3) Evaluate generalization across biological sex: a) Assess biological sex generalization\n using a non-linear regression model with fixed-effects, b) experiment with normalizing\n features between biological sexes, and c) develop mixed-effects models (e.g., Maximum\n Likelihood Estimation, Bayesian hierarchical models) with gender nesting. If the model\n generalizes well across biological sexes, loosen biological sex split and sample\n requirements for the Qualification Plan.\nRelevance to the Mission of the Agency: This project addresses the critical need for improved\nreliability and generalizability in mood disorder clinical trials, which have historically suffered\nfrom low FDA approval rates. By enhancing the quality of ClinROs, this research aligns with the\nFDA and HHS\u2019 missions to protect and promote public health and accelerate the development\nof effective, safe, and innovative therapeutics for mood disorders. The AI-COA\u2122 tool aims to\nincrease study power, reduce sample size requirements, and shorten trial durations, ultimately\ncontributing to more efficient and successful drug development processes.",

Furthermore, geostatistical modeling will be utilized to identify clusters of PTB throughout Harris\nCounty. Our central hypothesis underlying our research is that PAH exposures are associated with an\nincreased rate of PTB, that transcriptomics and epigenomics will yield readily translatable mechanistic\ninformation on this association, and geostatistical modeling will reveal increased clusters of PTB in proximity to\nSuperfund sites in Harris County.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\n Delayed identification of infant head malformation is causing unnecessary medical complications and societal\ncosts. A critical challenge in the early detection is the absence of tools available to pediatric offices to perform\nquantitative head shape assessment during well-child visits. Delays in diagnosis limit the opportunity for early,\nless invasive and effective treatment options. In this Fast-track SBIR project, PediaMetrix Inc. has joined forces\nwith pediatric hospitals and providers to develop and evaluate SoftSpotTM, which is the first mobile digital tool for\n3D data collection and analysis of infant cranial malformations at the point-of-care.\n Head malformations during infancy can be synostotic (i.e., craniosynostosis) or nonsynostotic (such as\ndeformational plagiocephaly and brachycephaly or DPB). Both types of conditions require immediate attention\nand benefit from early treatment to avoid long-term health complications. The prevalence of DPB increased\ndramatically in recent years, from 5% to approximately 20%-30%, causing the condition to be called a pediatric\nepidemic. Craniosynostosis is less common affecting 1 in 2,000 children. To improve the early management of\nthese conditions and to prevent more complex treatment and associated morbidities, it is essential to monitor\nthe growth of the infant head at the point-of-care.\n To address this unmet clinical need, we will develop and evaluate a mobile digital tool that will enable\npediatricians to capture and analyze 3D scans of every infant for the early diagnosis and management of cranial\nmalformations. In the Phase I of this project, we will develop a novel technology to rapidly capture and analyze\n3D data of the top of cranium in just seconds. We will use machine learning methods to automatically compute\nthe head shape parameters, including the head circumference which is routinely performed during every child\nvisit, but currently with an outdated and unreliable measuring tape. Our technology will be designed for the\ngeneral cranial evaluation of all infants during well-child visits. In Phase II, we will develop methods for the 3D\nreconstruction and analysis of the full cranium from a smartphone. We will also train deep learning models to\nclassify types of craniosynostosis and other cranial conditions and conduct clinical evaluation and user-feasibility\nstudies.\n The overall mission of PediaMetrix is to provide accurate decision support tools for pediatric health at the\npoint-of-care. This will be achieved through machine learning and quantitative imaging algorithms that in\ncombination with smartphone technological advances will be packaged as mobile digital health solutions\naccessible to pediatric health providers at any time and location. Successful demonstration of SoftSpot3DTM will\nlead to a significant reduction of the number of children left with untreated cranial conditions in addition to\nlowering the associated healthcare costs and social anxiety.",

    "abstract_text": "Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section\n\nDelayed identification of infant head malformation is causing unnecessary medical complications and societal costs. A critical challenge in the early detection is the absence of tools available to pediatric offices to perform quantitative head shape assessment during well-child visits. Delays in diagnosis limit the opportunity for early, less invasive and effective treatment options. In this Fast-track SBIR project, PediaMetrix Inc. has joined forces with pediatric hospitals and providers to develop and evaluate SoftSpotTM, which is the first mobile digital tool for 3D data collection and analysis of infant cranial malformations at the point-of-care.  Head malformations during infancy can be synostotic (i.e., craniosynostosis) or nonsynostotic (such as deformational plagiocephaly and brachycephaly or DPB). Both types of conditions require immediate attention and benefit from early treatment to avoid long-term health complications. The prevalence of DPB increased dramatically in recent years, from 5% to approximately 20%-30%, causing the condition to be called a pediatric epidemic. Craniosynostosis is less common affecting 1 in 2,000 children. To improve the early management of these conditions and to prevent more complex treatment and associated morbidities, it is essential to monitor the growth of the infant head at the point-of-care.\n\nTo address this unmet clinical need, under our parent grant, we will develop and evaluate a mobile digital tool that will enable pediatricians to capture and analyze 3D scans of every infant for the early diagnosis and management of cranial malformations. The proposed supplement project will perform market research for the direct to consumer (parents of newborns) as well as business to business (primary pediatric clinics) path for SoftSpot, development of financial projections (pro forma), running a pilot with a channel partner, finding the strategic partners, and improving the product (both technically and regulatory wise) to be ready for launch and scaling.  \n\nThe overall mission of PediaMetrix is to provide accurate decision support tools for pediatric health at the point-of-care. This will be achieved through machine learning and quantitative imaging algorithms that in combination with smartphone technological advances will be packaged as mobile digital health solutions accessible to pediatric health providers at any time and location. Successful demonstration of SoftSpot3DTM will lead to a significant reduction of the number of children left with untreated cranial conditions in addition to lowering the associated healthcare costs and social anxiety.",

    "abstract_text": "This study is part of the NIH\u2019s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions for the overdose epidemic, including opioid and stimulant use disorders. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to address the national opioid public health crisis and improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction.\nThis project seeks to address the overdose epidemic by working with overdose fatality review (OFR) teams. Current OFR practices rely on the case review model to make policy and programmatic recommendations. However, the continued rise in overdose rates and sheer number of preventable overdose deaths suggest a need to shift OFR teams away from case review and toward using timely population-level data to better inform their recommendations and actions. The goal of our proposed project, Fatal Overdose Review Teams \u2013 Research to Enhance Surveillance Systems (FORTRESS), is to improve standard OFR practices by equipping OFRs with a data dashboard built on real-time aggregate data, record-linked across multiple sources and presented in a way that helps identify and visualize common \u201coverdose touchpoints,\u201d or opportunities to deliver harm-reduction services or engage individuals at risk for overdose in evidence-based treatment. Aligning with the goals of the HEAL Data2Action Program, the FORTRESS research team will leverage available resources and expertise to help OFRs translate data to action. During the R61 Phase, the research team will strengthen established cross-sector partnerships with two state agencies, the Indiana Department of Health and the Indiana Management Performance Hub (MPH), which provide the necessary statewide data infrastructure to record-link population-level administrative data from multiple sources. MPH has also successfully developed publicly accessible data dashboards. The FORTRESS team will build on the early successes of MPH to ensure more timely collection of overdose event data and design the \u201cOverdose Touchpoints Dashboard\u201d (Aim 1). Our team will train OFR team members in Data-Driven Decision Making (DDDM) to effectively use the dashboard. The FORTRESS team also includes individuals involved in developing the CDC\u2019s OFR best practice guidelines and a pilot study of OFR adherence to these guidelines, which will inform our team\u2019s development of an \u201cOFR Fidelity Tool\u201d (Aim 2). This tool will be the first of its kind. For the R33 phase, we will conduct a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge trial comparing the impact of our intervention (dashboard + DDDM training) versus standard OFR practices on both implementation (Aim 3) and effectiveness outcomes (Aim 4). Implementation outcomes include implementation\nprocess fidelity (Stages of Implementation Completion), staff acceptance of harm reduction philosophies (qualitative interviews), OFR fidelity to CDC best practices (FORTRESS OFR Fidelity Tool), and usability of the Overdose Touchpoint Dashboard, (Systems Usability Scale). A statewide OFR data repository serves as a rich source of data on effectiveness outcomes, including OFR team recommendation quality and local actions to implement recommended overdose prevention strategies. We will also survey OFR team members to assess changes in their attitudes toward evidence-based overdose prevention strategies. In sum, the FORTRESS team is uniquely qualified to help OFRs use more comprehensive, available data to inform quality, action-oriented recommendations to reduce overdose.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nLewy body disorders, a subset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related disorders (ADRDs), are the second most\ncommon neurodegenerative disorders worldwide and the 14th leading cause of death in the United States.\nLewy body ADRDs are progressive, incurable, and mortality rates are rising, making end-of-life (EoL) care a\nsignificant public health concern. The majority of persons with Lewy body ADRDs are hospitalized in their last\n6 months of life with high rates of intensive care unit admission, in-hospital death, and low rates of discharge to\nhospice care. Because these markers of poor care quality are often incongruent with patient care preferences,\nurgent interventions are needed to improve EoL care quality in acute care hospitals. Despite this critical need,\nthere are two fundamental knowledge gaps in developing inpatient EoL interventions for persons with Lewy\nbody ADRDs: 1) lack of a prognostic model to determine risk of 6-month mortality and 2) lack of a validated\ntool to measure EoL care quality. This proposal requests support for a mentored career development award for\nDr. Whitley Aamodt, a movement disorders specialist, neurodegenerative neurologist, and clinical researcher\nat the University of Pennsylvania. The overarching goal of this project is to improve prognostication and EoL\ncare quality for hospitalized persons with Lewy body ADRDs by identifying patients at the greatest risk of death\nand ensuring that hospital-based care is appropriate and aligned with care preferences. In Aim 1, Dr. Aamodt\nwill use comprehensive Medicare data to develop a risk-prediction model for 6-month all-cause mortality in a\nnationally representative sample of hospitalized patients with Lewy body ADRDs using advanced predictive\nmodeling. This model will be externally validated in a second cohort of Medicare beneficiaries from the post-\npandemic period. In Aim 2, Dr. Aamodt will create, test, and externally validate a patient-centered EoL care\nquality instrument based on data gathered from diverse Lewy body ADRD patients, care partners, and\npractitioners using qualitative research methods and factor analysis. In executing these aims, Dr. Aamodt will\nobtain additional training in neuroepidemiology, biostatistics, and qualitative research under the guidance of\nmentors and advisors in epidemiologic research methods (John Farrar, MD, PhD), neurodegenerative disease\nepidemiology and health services research (Allison Willis, MD, MS), predictive modeling (Warren Bilker, PhD),\nqualitative research methods (Katharine Rendle, PhD, MPH), and palliative care research (Scott Halpern, MD,\nPhD). The results of this project will provide fundamental knowledge about hospitalized patients with Lewy\nbody ADRDs nearing EoL and will guide the development of future interventions to improve EoL care quality.\nThis work aligns with the strategic goal of the National Institute on Aging to address EoL care needs in ADRDs.\nThrough the research training and mentorship gained during this career development award, Dr. Aamodt will\nestablish herself as an independent investigator in the field of applied epidemiology, outcomes research, and\npalliative and EoL care for aging Americans with neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nThe objective of this project is to investigate voice changes associated with speaking in challenging acoustic\nenvironments to better inform clinical care for individuals with voice disorders. Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD)\nis a common voice disorder that often results in difficulty communicating in daily life. Many people experience\nvoice symptoms from speaking in noisy environments; for most, the symptoms resolve quickly. However, for\nthose with MTD, voice symptoms often persist, making it difficult for them to meet their occupational and social\nvocal demands. The reasons for this persistence are unknown. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the\nunderlying mechanisms of voice production in noisy environments to optimize and individualize voice\nassessment and treatment for these individuals with MTD. Most speakers increase their vocal intensity while\nspeaking in noisy environments, a phenomenon known as the Lombard effect. Speaking during and after\nexposure to a loud environment presumably requires monitoring of both background noise and one\u2019s own voice,\nand then responding with vocal motor adjustments. This implies that sensorimotor integration is crucial in these\nreal-life circumstances. There is preliminary evidence that individuals with MTD have atypical auditory-motor\nintegration and an atypical persistence of Lombard responses after speaking in noise. However, no known\nstudies have comprehensively characterized the underlying mechanisms and clinically relevant voice changes\nof the Lombard effect for those with and without MTD. To develop evidenced-based diagnostics and targeted\nvoice treatments, we must better understand the processes and voice changes associated with speaking in daily\nlife. Therefore, the specific aims of this project are to 1) investigate the sensorimotor mechanisms of the Lombard\neffect and 2) characterize clinically relevant voice changes associated with the Lombard effect for individuals\nwith and without MTD within a communicative context. Sixty speakers (30 with MTD and 30 without) will complete\na Lombard task to measure vocal responses and self-reported vocal effort while communicating during and after\nexposure to a noisy environment. Inexperienced listeners will rate overall severity of dysphonia for the speakers\u2019\nspeech samples from the Lombard task. Lombard responses will be analyzed behaviorally and neuro-\ncomputationally, and they will be compared between the groups and across various stages of the Lombard task.\nClinically relevant vocal measures (i.e., acoustic, self-reported vocal effort, and listener-auditory perceptual\nratings of overall severity of dysphonia) of the Lombard task will be compared across groups and phases of the\nexperimental task. This project is theoretically and clinically significant; it will fill in a substantial gap, providing\ntheoretical insight into the sensorimotor mechanisms of MTD in real-life environmental contexts, and contributing\nto the clinical evidence to improve diagnostics and individualize treatment for those with sensorimotor deficits\nunderlying their voice disorders.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n The long-term goal of this K23 Career Development Award is to prepare the PI (Rachel Aaron, PhD) for\nan independent research career that aims to promote adaptive recovery for individuals who survive orthopedic\ntrauma. Orthopedic trauma, resulting in severe injuries such as multiple fractures or amputation, occurs in\naround 3 million people annually in the United States; about half of survivors experience persistent pain and\npsychological distress in the year following injury, and most report substantial disability 7 years post trauma.\nThere is an urgent need to identify factors that underlie pain and psychological distress following orthopedic\ntrauma and to develop targeted psychological interventions to treat these potentially disabling symptoms.\n The broader literature suggests that difficulties with emotion regulation (i.e., identifying one's emotions\nand engaging in strategies to up- or down-regulate them) and central sensitization (i.e., alterations in the\nendogenous modulation of pain) lead to poor pain-related outcomes. Using a theory-driven assessment of\nemotion regulation, and gold-standard, laboratory-based assessment of central sensitization (quantitative\nsensory testing [QST]), Study 1 will examine emotion regulation difficulties and central sensitization at 6 weeks\npost trauma as predictors of persistent pain, distress, and opioid use 6 months post trauma. Study 2 will test\nthe feasibility of assessing and delivering Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET) to people\nwho endorse persistent pain (i.e., clinically significant pain, present most days for the past 3 months) at 6\nmonths post trauma. EAET is a novel chronic pain psychology intervention that treats pain and distress by\ntargeting trauma-related emotion regulation process. Trauma exposure is ubiquitous among orthopedic trauma\nsurvivors; thus, EAET may be ideally suited for those with persistent pain post trauma. However, the feasibility\nof delivering EAET is unclear due to established barriers engaging this population in mental health treatment.\n Proposed research and career development activities will take place at Johns Hopkins University\n(JHU), a renowned research environment. JHU is dedicated to the success of its junior faculty and provides\nunique access to orthopedic trauma patients. The PI has formed a strong team of content experts in central\nsensitization (including QST), psychological intervention (including EAET), and orthopedic trauma. Immersed\nin JHU's rich training environment, the PI will achieve the following career goals through dedicated mentorship,\ndidactic experiences, and professional development opportunities: (1) develop expertise in the assessment of\ncentral sensitization, including QST; (2) gain foundational skills for intervention development, implementation,\nand analysis; and (3) learn to lead impactful orthopedic trauma clinical research. The completion of this K23\nproposal will provide the necessary training and preliminary data for the PI to obtain independent grant funding\nand systematically pursue a line of research to improve outcomes for survivors of orthopedic trauma.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n The long-term goal of this K23 Career Development Award is to prepare the PI (Rachel Aaron, PhD) for\nan independent research career that aims to promote adaptive recovery for individuals who survive orthopedic\ntrauma. Orthopedic trauma, resulting in severe injuries such as multiple fractures or amputation, occurs in\naround 3 million people annually in the United States; about half of survivors experience persistent pain and\npsychological distress in the year following injury, and most report substantial disability 7 years post trauma.\nThere is an urgent need to identify factors that underlie pain and psychological distress following orthopedic\ntrauma and to develop targeted psychological interventions to treat these potentially disabling symptoms.\n The broader literature suggests that difficulties with emotion regulation (i.e., identifying one's emotions\nand engaging in strategies to up- or down-regulate them) and central sensitization (i.e., alterations in the\nendogenous modulation of pain) lead to poor pain-related outcomes. Using a theory-driven assessment of\nemotion regulation, and gold-standard, laboratory-based assessment of central sensitization (quantitative\nsensory testing [QST]), Study 1 will examine emotion regulation difficulties and central sensitization at 6 weeks\npost trauma as predictors of persistent pain, distress, and opioid use 6 months post trauma. Study 2 will test\nthe feasibility of assessing and delivering Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET) to people\nwho endorse persistent pain (i.e., clinically significant pain, present most days for the past 3 months) at 6\nmonths post trauma. EAET is a novel chronic pain psychology intervention that treats pain and distress by\ntargeting trauma-related emotion regulation process. Trauma exposure is ubiquitous among orthopedic trauma\nsurvivors; thus, EAET may be ideally suited for those with persistent pain post trauma. However, the feasibility\nof delivering EAET is unclear due to established barriers engaging this population in mental health treatment.\n Proposed research and career development activities will take place at Johns Hopkins University\n(JHU), a renowned research environment. JHU is dedicated to the success of its junior faculty and provides\nunique access to orthopedic trauma patients. The PI has formed a strong team of content experts in central\nsensitization (including QST), psychological intervention (including EAET), and orthopedic trauma. Immersed\nin JHU's rich training environment, the PI will achieve the following career goals through dedicated mentorship,\ndidactic experiences, and professional development opportunities: (1) develop expertise in the assessment of\ncentral sensitization, including QST; (2) gain foundational skills for intervention development, implementation,\nand analysis; and (3) learn to lead impactful orthopedic trauma clinical research. The completion of this K23\nproposal will provide the necessary training and preliminary data for the PI to obtain independent grant funding\nand systematically pursue a line of research to improve outcomes for survivors of orthopedic trauma.",

    "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nOrthopedic trauma is common and often associated with profound pain and psychological distress that can\npersist for years following injury and relate to long-term disability. To promote adaptive recovery, there is an\nurgent need to elucidate factors that relate to pain and distress following orthopedic trauma and to develop\ntargeted psychological interventions that address these potentially disabling symptoms. This project will take\ninitial steps towards addressing this gap and will lay the groundwork for an independent research program that\nwill harness pain pathophysiology and affective science to promote adaptive recovery following orthopedic\ntrauma.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT\nThe NIH has called for testing promising implementation strategies (PAR-19-274) and there is a critical need for\nimplementation and sustainment of effective and evidence-based practices (EBPs) to address health conditions\nincluding substance use disorders (SUDs). This proposed project is consistent with NIDA\u2019s Priority Focus Area\n\u201cStrategies to improve the effective and sustainable implementation of evidence-based prevention and treatment\ninterventions (implementation science).\u201d Most implementation strategies do not address the complex multilevel\ncontext for implementation in public service sectors. This proposed project will expand the Leadership and\nOrganizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) intervention, an innovative organizational change strategy for\nEBP implementation and sustainment, to include partnership with a statewide Department of Mental Health and\nAddiction (DMHA) and Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) in order to align state-level leadership\npolicies and directives with organizational implementation improvement strategies. SUDs are among the most\ncomplex of public health issues and Indiana ranks as the fourth worst state in providing SUD services with about\n8.5% of the population meeting criteria for a SUD, of whom only 13.6% seek treatment. Indiana DMHA\napproached the UCSD LOCI team to aid in the implementation of combined Motivational Enhancement\nTherapy/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT) The main innovation in this project is that, consistent with the\nExploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework and system and organizational theory,\nwe will add a system level component to LOCI with the goal of bridging outer and inner context and developing\nand aligning a positive implementation climate to support implementation and sustainment of MET/CBT for\nSUDs. This project will test an implementation strategy that seeks to align, system, organization, and clinic\nleadership and strategies to implement and sustain an EBP for substance use disorders. The Leadership and\nOrganizational Change for Implementation - System Level (LOCI-SL) seeks to improve implementation\nleadership, climate, provider attitudes and behaviors, and EBP fidelity and client engagement in services. LOCI-\nSL will be tested in a statewide mental health and addiction service system and its community mental health\ncenters.",

    "abstract_text": "Program Summary\nNigeria has one of the largest HIV epidemics in the world with 1.8 million people living with HIV infection. With\nan estimated female population of 102 million and HIV prevalence of 1.6% among adult females, Nigeria has the\nlargest population of women and the 4th largest number of women living with HIV (WLHIV) in Africa. Although\naccess to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among WLHIV in Nigeria has increased over the years, with over 98% of\nthe 960,000 WLHIV on ART, AIDS-related mortality remains high. In 2020, 16,000 WLHIV died from AIDS-\nrelated illnesses including cervical cancer. A pilot implementation program in Nigeria demonstrated that\nleveraging the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) supported HIV programs for the\nprovision of evidence-based cervical cancer screen-and-treat interventions in WLWH is feasible. The pilot\nprogram demonstrated, however, that tailored implementation strategies will be needed to address specific\nmultilevel barriers along the cancer control continuum in order to address adoption, reach, and sustainability that\nare necessary for successful scale-up. However, in many African countries with a high burden of both HIV and\ncervical cancer, there is a paucity of evidence-based implementation strategies to inform effective integration of\nHIV and cervical cancer services delivery. Objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Refine strategies to integrate\ncervical cancer screening, treatment and management within existing comprehensive HIV treatment programs\nand determine implementation readiness; 2) Determine the comparative effectiveness of a Core set of\nimplementation strategies versus Core+ enhanced implementation strategies; and 3) assess sustainment of the\nintegration of cervical cancer screening, treatment, and management intervention into HIV programs. We have\nassembled a strong team from University of California San Diego; University of Nigeria, Nsukka and John\nHopkins University with expertise in implementation science, HIV care and research, and cancer care and\nresearch. Our proposal is responsive to the NCI RFA and consistent with the World Health Organization global\nplan of elimination of cervical cancer by 2030. If effective, the proposed project will result in a set of feasible,\nculturally adaptable, and sustainable implementation strategies to integrate evidence-based cervical cancer\nscreening and treatment into HIV programs in order to improve the health and life expectancy of WLHIV.",

    "abstract_text": "Program Summary\nNigeria has one of the largest HIV epidemics in the world with 1.8 million people living with HIV infection. The\nUnited States government has made huge investments in HIV care and research in Nigeria, through the\nPresidents Emergency Funds for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-supported programs and the National Institutes for\nHealth (NIH) research training grants that have supported the training of researchers in Nigerian universities.\nResearch on HIV in Nigeria has contributed significantly to the management, treatment, and prevention of HIV\nin the country as well to the development of international guidelines worldwide. The University of Nigeria Nsukka\n(UNN) College of Medicine has implemented multiple HIV research projects mostly as a sub-awardee. Findings\nfrom our rapid needs assessment with 84 UNN researchers and research administrators indicated that 93% of\nresearchers expressed interest in submitting grant applications, including for HIV research, but only 28% knew\nwho to contact for proposal and submission support at UNN. For UNN to successfully submit and manage grant\napplications as a prime institution, there is need to strengthen its research administration and management\ninfrastructure. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) further identify needs and gaps in research administration\nand management at UNN; 2) improve the grants management and proposal development knowledge and skills\nof UNN research administrators and HIV implementation researchers; and 3) strengthen the ability of UNN\nresearch administrators and HIV implementation researchers to submit and manage successful HIV grant\napplications by providing mentorship, ongoing coaching and online courses from UCSD program instructors. UC\nSan Diego experts in research administration and grant management will implement the objectives of the\nproposed infrastructure development training program. The proposed program will be led by Dr. Gregory Aarons,\nProfessor and Director of UC San Diego Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute Dissemination and\nImplementation Science Center (DISC) as Program Director, and Dr. Echezona Ezeanolue, Professor and\nDirector of UNN Centre for Translation and Implementation Research (CTAIR) as Co-Director. Drs. Aarons and\nEzeanolue have an existing relationship and extensive experience building capacity in Nigerian institutions\nthrough the Nigeria Implementation Science Alliance (NISA). A team of research administration and grant\nmanagement experts from UC San Diego will train and provide ongoing mentoring to research administrators\nand grant management staff at UNN over a 3-year period. By the end of this infrastructure development training\nprogram, 12 UNN research administrators and grant managers will be able to successfully submit and manage\nNIH, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other funded HIV grants.",

The proposal will\ntrain and mentor 12 UNN trainees through hands-on workshops and mentorship programs, and teach dozens of\ntrainees through online courses to meet the demand for grant funds accountability.",
