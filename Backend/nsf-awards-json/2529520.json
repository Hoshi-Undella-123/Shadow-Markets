 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will provide partial support for a three-day workshop on Quantum Sensing for Biomedical Applications planned for August 4-6, 2025 at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA. Two days will be devoted to intensive lectures on mathematics essential for understanding quantum mechanics, followed by foundational quantum physics necessary for comprehending quantum sensing.  The last day of the workshop will expose workshop participants to leading-edge research presentations delivered by invited guest lecturers. Participants for the workshop will be selected from junior and senior undergraduate and first-year graduate students, and young professionals.  The majority of about 55 students attending the workshop will be recruited from Pittsburgh area universities that include Carnegie Mellon University, Duquesne University, and the University of Pittsburgh, and six will be recruited from other universities. \r\n\r\nQuantum technology, and quantum sensing in particular, are expected to have broad and significant impact. The cross-disciplinary nature of the field requires foundational knowledge in various areas of mathematics and physics; these are in addition to knowledge in specific application areas. The purpose of the workshop is (i) to introduce junior and senior undergraduate and first-year graduate students, and young professionals to essential foundational knowledge on quantum sensing, and (ii) to expose them to leading-edge research in the field. This activity will benefit participants by making them aware of potential opportunities in an emerging field early in their technical education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
