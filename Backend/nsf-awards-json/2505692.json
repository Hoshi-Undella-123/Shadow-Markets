 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the critical challenge of detecting harmful mycotoxins in the food supply chain. Mycotoxins, which are toxic compounds produced by certain fungi, contaminate approximately 25 percent of global food crops annually, resulting in billions of dollars in economic losses and posing significant health risks to both humans and animals. The development of a portable, cost-effective detection system will enable rapid on-site testing throughout the food production and distribution process, from farm to table. This capability will help prevent contaminated products from entering the food supply, thereby protecting public health and reducing economic losses in the agriculture sector. The technology has potential applications across multiple industries, including agriculture, food processing, and quality control laboratories. Successful commercialization of this technology will create high-skilled jobs in sensor manufacturing and technical support while generating tax revenue through domestic and international sales. Additionally, this innovation will strengthen the United States position as a leader in food safety technology and agricultural innovation.\r\n\r\nThis project introduces breakthrough sensor technology for mycotoxin detection through the integration of three innovative components. The primary technical innovation centers on the development of synthetic molecular imprinted polymers that function as artificial antibodies, specifically engineered to detect mycotoxins with high selectivity. These polymers are combined with plasmonic nanoparticles that enhance fluorescence signals, enabling detection of extremely low mycotoxin concentrations. The technology incorporates smartphone-based signal processing and analysis capabilities, making it accessible for field use. The research goals include researching the molecular imprinted polymer synthesis for maximum selectivity, controlling the plasmon-enhanced fluorescence mechanism for improved sensitivity, and developing robust algorithms for accurate quantification of mycotoxin levels. The methodological approach involves systematic testing of polymer formulations and validation against established detection methods. This integrated system aims to achieve detection limits superior to conventional testing methods while maintaining reliability and ease of use.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
