 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program in the Division of Chemistry Professor Marvin Parasram of New York University is studying the development of spatially controlled C\u2013H functionalization reactions empowered by photochromic directing groups. The ability to functionalize strong and prevalent C\u2013H bonds is a contemporary challenge in synthetic chemistry. Scientific advances in the area of transition metal (TM) catalyzed directed C\u2013H functionalization reactions are limited to mono-functionalization using difficult-to-remove directing groups (DG). Moreover, the planarity of the employed DGs does not allow for spatial control, and functionalization is limited to predisposed C\u2013H bonds based on favorable organometallic cycles. The research team will investigate the merger of photochromism and TM\u2013catalyzed C\u2013H functionalization to empower directional control of DGs to enable last-stage C\u2013H difunctionalization at different spatial sites of the molecule. The ability to utilize photochromic DGs for positional controlled C\u2013H functionalization has the potential to expedite the synthesis of important synthetic cores in a highly selective and diverse manner, thereby solving a prominent challenge in synthesis. The education and outreach activities will focus on increasing STEM interest through the development of research-based STEM laboratory classes for undergraduate and high-school students. For graduate students, a non-technical seminar focusing on a speaker\u2019s career journey toward achieving their scientific career goals will be carried out. Lastly, a social/networking triannual symposium with the organic divisions of local New York City universities will be created to promote scientific interactions with graduate students and postdocs.\r\n \r\nIn this work, Dr. Parasram leverages the interplay between photochromism and TM-catalyzed directed C\u2013H functionalization to enable spatial selective C\u2013H difunctionalization of organic molecules. The PI seeks to overcome the inherent limitations of state-of-the-art methodologies by 1) employing easy-to-remove photochromic DGs, 2) allowing directionality control of the directing group using different wavelengths of light, and 3) employing unsymmetrical electrophiles to generate unsymmetrical difunctionalized products. Objective 1 explores the use of innate functional groups as photoswitchable DGs to facilitate two separate and spatially different C\u2013H functionalization events, allowing for the multivectorization of organic motifs in a highly selective and efficient manner. Methods to carry out this approach asymmetrically using chiral ligands, and applications to access molecular scaffolds of biological interest including natural products will be explored. Objective 2 investigates the use of designer photochromic DGs for the difunctionalization of heterocyclic motifs. The directionality control of the photochromic DGs can enable the functionalization of unconventional C\u2013H sites on heterocycles, thus, solving a longstanding problem in the field.\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
