 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to establish a CyberTraining Network for Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) in Disaster Management. Through the proposed CyberTraining activities, the project will enable disaster management students, researchers, and professionals, to strengthen their capabilities in cyberinfrastructure and GeoAI. By broadening access to GeoAI and cyberinfrastructure, the project will support research workforce development across various disciplines, including disaster science, geosciences, transportation, and engineering. The team will collaborate with academia, industry, non-profit organizations, and government agencies to provide open access to disaster-related data, training materials, and cyberinfrastructure resources. To ensure scalability and sustainability, the project will be supported by core partner organizations and integrated with National Science Foundation funded cyberinfrastructure, disaster data providers, professional societies, and industry stakeholders. Students and educators will be actively engaged through a participant award program, expanding educational and career development opportunities. Furthermore, this project will enable disaster researchers to advance their use of cyberinfrastructure and GeoAI in disaster management, enhance computational skills, and improve data-driven decision-making for increased disaster resilience. The project is designed to significantly improve the well-being of populations affected by natural hazards and disasters.\r\n\r\nThis project will establish a CyberTraining Network for Geospatial Artificial Intelligence in Disaster Management (GeoAIDM), and provide training to disaster research communities (researcher, students, and professional) on Cyberinfrastructure (CI) and GeoAI skills. The project will 1) establish a GeoAIDM research network that connects institutions, government agencies, hazard research centers, industry, and educational organizations to advance training materials for preparing the current and next-generation workforce; 2) develop a GeoAIDM curriculum for summer schools, webinars, and workshops that utilize GeoAI techniques for effective disaster management; 3) integrate training materials into educational programs, 4) introduce GeoAI to train participants in analyzing and interpreting spatial patterns of disasters and their associated impacts. The proposed project will train 2,000 students and educators.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
