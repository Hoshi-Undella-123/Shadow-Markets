 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) are pervasive with applications in various areas such as computer networks, robotics, and power grids. For example, multi-robot systems play a critical role in our society, including industrial robots in car assembly lines, hundreds of drones in a light show, and many vehicles in future autonomous ride-sharing services. Sequential decision-making is crucial to construct functional, intelligent MAS that can meet our needs. Multi-agent reinforcement learning is an approach that facilitates machine learning through feedback that reinforces the desired behavior. However, this approach requires a quantitative reward function that is oftentimes unavailable or hard to design. Formal methods (FM), by nature, can accurately specify and verify software and hardware systems. This project aims to combine the two approaches in order to construct multi-agent systems that are more scalable, easier to understand, and safer. The investigators will also disseminate research findings, integrate them in teaching, and train graduate and undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project has the following three research objectives. Objective A develops novel specification-guided Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approaches that optimally decompose the specification and assign the resulting parts to agents. The principled and interpretable methods can learn a \u201ccorrect by construction\u201d scheduler to decompose signal temporal logic specifications optimally, corresponding to the credit assignment in specification-guided MARL. Objective B aims to analyze and explain the emergent coordinated behaviors of MARL by mining specifications from the trajectory rollouts of the policies. An interaction graph in the MAS is first learned by graph neural networks, followed by a novel template-free, generative approach for specification mining in a hierarchical and scalable manner. Objective C aims to enable the transfer of MARL policies across a distribution of tasks by simultaneous specification inference and policy learning. A specification-guided meta MARL approach is developed based on approximate Bayesian inference. This work can lead to more scalable and robust autonomy in factories, warehouses, hospitals, and homes. Concrete examples include large-scale self-driving vehicles, off-road autonomy in the wild, and advanced air mobility.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
