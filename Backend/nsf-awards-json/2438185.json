 "awd_abstract_narration": "The SFS program at the University of Maryland in Baltimore County (UMBC) is proposing to increase the number of qualified professionals who will be highly skilled in both cybersecurity (cyber) and artificial intelligence (AI), to strengthen United States\u2019 security and competitiveness. America needs more cybersecurity professionals, and AI is becoming a critical aspect of all fields including cyber. UMBC\u2019s SFS program attracts qualified students to UMBC\u2019s undergraduate and graduate programs in cybersecurity, producing cyber professionals in service to the Nation in federal, state, local, or tribal government. In a broader context, the UMBC\u2019s approach provides a model to other schools for active project-based curriculum enhancements, including using the campus network as a research laboratory.\r\n\r\nUMBC is an R1 university, as well a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD) and a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Research (CAE-R) - designated by the National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity (NCAE-C). UMBC\u2019s strengths include its technical research capabilities and integration of the cybersecurity discipline with real-world experience through project-based learning, which will contribute to SFS students being prepared and placed into government jobs. Beyond coursework, the Empowering New Growth through Active Group Engagement (ENGAGE) program will foster theoretical and practical knowledge using project-based learning for students in cyber and AI. Each year, all UMBC SFS scholars engage in collaborative applied research study focusing on some aspects of the UMBC computing systems. In addition, each SFS scholar is expected to participate actively in a cyber- or AI-related UMBC research group or student activity. UMBC offers many project-based special topics courses on cyber, including malware analysis, data privacy, and INSuRE cyber research. In addition to working with individual faculty members, SFS scholars have opportunities to engage in research projects at partner organizations.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.\u202f\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
