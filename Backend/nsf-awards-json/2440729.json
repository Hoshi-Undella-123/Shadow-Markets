 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project seeks to uncover the fundamental principles governing how cells sense and respond to mechanical forces at their surface, a process critical to numerous biological functions and human diseases. By focusing on mechanosensitive membrane proteins, this work will provide new insights towards understanding cell migration, tissue homeostasis, and touch sensation. The project will also enrich interdisciplinary education through integrated teaching, mentoring, and outreach activities, benefiting students at multiple levels.\r\n\r\nThe research will employ advanced microscopy and biophysical tools to systematically investigate the interplay between cell membrane properties (e.g., tension, curvature, composition, and dynamics) and the subcellular behavior (e.g., distribution and activity) of mechanosensitive membrane proteins. Using Piezo channels as a primary example, the study aims to establish a thermodynamic framework for understanding mechanosensitive membrane proteins behavior at the subcellular level and explore their dynamic behavior within the cell membrane. This multifaceted approach will generate a comprehensive understanding of mechanosensing at the subcellular level, which could lead to potential applications in therapeutic development for various mechanobiological diseases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
