 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in its potential to save lives by enabling earlier cancer diagnosis, which is known to significantly improve treatment outcomes and survival. Despite this, there are currently no effective early diagnostic tools for many types of cancer. Head and neck cancer is one such disease, with rising incidence and mortality rates, particularly among men. It is often detected late, typically during routine exams, only after symptoms become evident, by which point treatment options are limited and outcomes are poor. This project seeks to change that by developing a non-invasive, saliva-based test that can deliver accurate results within 30 minutes at the point of care. This approach could dramatically reduce the time to diagnosis, eliminate the need for invasive biopsies, and expand access to early cancer detection. By reducing the burden of late-stage diagnosis and enabling timely intervention, this innovation has the potential to lower healthcare costs, improve quality of life, and address significant gaps in health equity. Its modular design also allows for future adaptation to detect other cancers.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop and validate a portable diagnostic system that detects cancer markers for both risk and progression in saliva. The research will focus on creating a fully integrated microfluidic device that combines multiple types of biomarker detection into one enclosed cartridge. The project will address key technical challenges such as improving the consistency of sample handling, ensuring even distribution of reagents, and optimizing the materials and layout to support accurate, reliable results. The system will be tested using samples with known cancer markers to confirm performance against standard laboratory methods. The anticipated outcome is a working prototype that demonstrates the technical feasibility of delivering multi-biomarker analysis from a single non-invasive sample at the point of care.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
