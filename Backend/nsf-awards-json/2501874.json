 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scarcity of water in some regions of the U.S. presents a significant challenge. One alternative water resource is produced water (PW) from oil and gas production wells. This type of water can be an important water resource, especially for oil-producing states like Texas and New Mexico that experience high water stress. However, PW is highly saline and contains a wide range of contaminants. This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project explores a cost-effective and energy-efficient technology called solar distillation, which can be used to treat PW. The project will address how oil-related compounds and chemicals used in oilfield operations affect the rate of water evaporation and the quality of the distilled product. The project also includes educational outreach. The research team will develop an educational module and hands-on activity kits to help students understand PW and how solar distillation can treat it. K-12 and undergraduate students will learn about the PW solar distillation system. \r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the fundamental scientific question of how oil-derived contaminants and chemical additives in PW influence the performance of passive solar distillation systems. The study focuses on PW generated in the Permian Basin, the largest oil-producing region in the U.S. The study investigates the effects of oil-related compounds and chemical additives, commonly found in PW, on water evaporation rates and the quality of the distilled product. To achieve these objectives, the project will employ a comprehensive methodology that includes four main components: (1) a thorough characterization of the physical and chemical properties of PW samples from various field sites in Permian Basin; (2) solar distillation experiments utilizing synthetic PW that incorporates representative oil-related compounds; (3) an evaluation of how different chemical additives influence distillation performance; and (4) the development of educational resources aimed at disseminating the research findings. The experimental approach will consist of controlled laboratory studies complemented by outdoor solar experiments utilizing custom-built passive solar distillation modules. The project will measure evaporation rates, monitor temperature and humidity, and conduct water quality analyses of both the feed water and the distilled product. The outcomes of this research are expected to inform optimal pretreatment strategies and system designs, thereby enhancing the efficiency and reliability of solar distillation for PW treatment. Ultimately, the broader impacts of this work include advancing water sustainability in oil-producing regions, decreasing dependency on groundwater resources, and providing students with hands-on experience in emerging water treatment technologies, thus supporting educational initiatives in the classroom and community settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
