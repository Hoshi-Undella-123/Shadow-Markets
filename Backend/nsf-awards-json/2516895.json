 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding human responses to change is essential to our knowledge of past, present, and future human behavior. Contributing to questions of human adaptability in long-term human-environment relationships, this study assesses how human social dynamics and strategies and technological innovations relate to environmental shifts. To achieve this goal, the study integrates archaeological and paleoecological data with existing knowledge.  The study strengthens USA STEM workforce by training K-12 students on annotated 3D artifact models, immersive site visualizations, and virtual tours. The study also offers training opportunities for students in higher education. This study advances NSF investments in understanding human adoption of biotechnology innovations through its implementation of biotechnology methods in its analysis of stable isotopes and phytolith composition. \r\n\r\nExcavations are planned using current archaeological information that is integrated with 3D models.  Material culture is recovered, provenience is detailed, and all evidence is analyzed applying existing standard methods. Bulk and micromorphological samples are collected from strata and excavation profiles, respectively. Microbotanical remains (pollen and phytoliths) are recovered and classified by taxon. Additional paleoecological information is obtained by applying flotation techniques. Stable isotope information is obtained from unmodified eggshells. Micro and macrofaunal remains are recovered and identified. Cultural and paleoecological data are integrated and interpreted applying existing ecological knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
