 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to address the critical challenges in treatment of second-degree burn wounds, which affect over a million individuals annually in the US. Despite advancement in treating wet wounds, existing products fail in the management of burn wounds, causing excessive pain, infection, prolonged healing, and poor functional and aesthetic restoration. This project introduces a novel bioactive hydrogel dressing with a breathable, porous contact designed to accelerate natural healing processes and reduce the trauma associated with dressing changes and body movement. The transparent appearance and bioactive formulation of the proposed dressing allow for non-invasive assessment of the wound and maintain optimal moisture levels for up to 10 days, reducing the frequency of dressing changes. The proposed dressing's extended operational time and enhanced stability offer an effective solution that lowers overall treatment costs, reduces hospital visits, and alleviates the workload on healthcare professionals. This hydrogel dressing is poised to fulfill a substantial demand in the US wound care market by addressing the critical gaps in existing treatments for second-degree burns and other low-exuding wounds such as necrotic wounds and radiation-induced dermatitis.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project aims to develop a novel dressing prototype, composed of natural hydrogels enriched with bioactive compounds, utilizing 3D printing technology. Burn wounds are prone to dehydration, which can cause dressings to adhere to the wound bed, resulting in pain and trauma during removal. The proposed project aims at developing hydrogel dressings with porous surface to distribute the pull-off force across an extended interface area, reducing trauma during the dressing removal. The proposed project will evaluate the antibacterial properties of the dressings, as wound infection significantly delay healing and increase complications. Additionally, the project aims to assess the dressing's anti-inflammatory effects by measuring the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a preclinical mouse model. The anticipated technical results include the fabrication of 3D-printed dressings in various sizes, shapes, and pore designs, evaluating their mechanical stability and distribution of pull-off force, followed by validation of their antibacterial activity and ability to modulate inflammatory responses. Achieving these milestones will result in an advanced wound dressing prototype for second-degree burn wounds, supporting its safety and effectiveness in promoting favorable inflammatory response and wound healing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
