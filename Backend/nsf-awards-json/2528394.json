 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in addressing the critical challenge of inadequate weather forecasting due to the scarcity of in-situ atmospheric data over oceans and under-sampled regions. Improved forecasting can lead to better preparation for weather-related disasters, saving lives and property and aiding in climate adaptation efforts. The proposed project has significant potential impacts on society and the environment by enhancing the accuracy of weather forecasts globally. Accurate weather forecasting is critical for sectors such as agriculture, logistics, insurance, and renewable energy, and this project can contribute meaningfully to meet those needs. In agriculture, farmers may use hyper-local, high-accuracy forecasts to optimize planting, irrigation, and harvesting, potentially boosting agricultural output and improving food security in disaster-prone regions. Logistics companies could streamline shipping routes and reduce fuel costs by anticipating weather disruptions with greater accuracy. The insurance industry may leverage detailed weather data to better assess risks and offer more targeted coverage, saving billions in payouts due to inaccurate predictions. With days, not hours, of advance warning for hurricanes, floods, and other extreme events, thousands of lives can be saved each year, and economic losses reduced by billions. Governments and military agencies may gain unprecedented access to detailed weather data, crucial for strategic planning and operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is in developing a global network of long-duration, low-cost, lightweight weather balloons to significantly reduce or eliminate weather forecast uncertainty by filling data gaps over oceans and developing countries. The project aims to deploy a constellation of balloons capable of remaining aloft for 60+ days, collecting atmospheric data. The goals of the proposed R&D are to deploy an initial constellation of systems capable of atmospheric sensing and real-time communication and to develop data assimilation partnerships with industry and government to use this new data effectively. The plan involves iterative testing of the balloon systems, validation of their performance in real-world conditions, development of fleet management and mission control software, and deployment of a pilot-scale constellation. Each balloon carries a sophisticated payload, including miniaturized sensors, satellite communication, and a unique non-consumable altitude control system. This patented technology aims to allow the balloons to transition vertically between sea level and the stratosphere, collecting detailed atmospheric profiles and even \"station-seeking\" over specific regions of interest. This would translate to dramatically increasing the resolution and frequency of weather data compared to sporadic radiosonde launches.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
