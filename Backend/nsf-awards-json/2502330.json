 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract:\r\nThe stimuli-responsive behavior of polymers and other networks of flexible chains is governed by properties such as supramolecular interactions (including hydrogen bonding), entanglements, and system dynamics. This proposal aims to advance the fundamental understanding of stimuli-responsive materials by investigating the structure-function relationships in entangled polymer chains and fibrous systems across scales. To generate new knowledge in fundamental polymer science, this project will focus on three main objectives addressing the following research questions: (1) How is supramolecular hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) disrupted or promoted through interactions with other species? (2) How do the thermal properties and heating profile dynamically affect polymer morphology and its relationship to bulk behavior? and (3) How do random entanglements of Shape Memory Polymer (SMP) fiber \u201cchains\u201d contribute to motion in textiles? In parallel, this project will support the PI\u2019s mission to foster a diverse and inclusive lab environment. Through mentorship, outreach, and research opportunities, the PI will expose a broad range of students to soft materials, cultivating a collaborative space for emerging talent. Additionally, this project will aid in the setup of the Sanchez (\u201cTheory to Execution\u201d) texlab and support the generation of preliminary data, positioning the PI to pursue future work aligned with DMR\u2019s goals.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Abstract:\r\nThis proposal aims to advance the fundamental understanding of stimuli-responsive materials by investigating the structure-function relationships in entangled polymer chains and fibrous systems across scales.
