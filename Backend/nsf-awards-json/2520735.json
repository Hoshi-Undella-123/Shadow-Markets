 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Algebraic Topology: Methods, Computation, and Science (ATMCS)\" is the main conference in the rapidly expanding field of applied algebraic topology. ATMCS11 will be held 21-25 July 2025 at Montana State University in Bozeman, MT. The conference program includes 13 invited talks, contributed talks, and a poster session. This project will support speaker-participants, as well as US-based student and early-career participants. The conference will convene approximately 250 researchers in applied topology, construed broadly. As ATMCS9 was cancelled due to COVID-19, ATMCS11 is only the second time that this international conference is hosted in the USA. In addition, as this conference is typically held bi-annually, ATMCS11 has a strong potential to set new research directions and collaborations.\r\n\r\nBy providing funding for convening experts in applied and computational topology across the globe and funding US-based participants, this award will directly impact the state of research in applied and computational topology both in the US and around the world. The meeting will benefit the researchers who attend by exposing them to some of the latest results across a wide domain of applied and computational topology. In addition, the results presented at the conference will be broadly disseminated both through extended abstracts posted on the conference website and a follow-up special issue of the Springer journal La Matematica. A conference website is available at https://comptag.github.io/atmcs11/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
