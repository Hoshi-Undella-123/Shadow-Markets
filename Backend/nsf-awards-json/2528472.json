 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to provide travel scholarships for 45-50 students to attend the North American Catalysis Society Meeting (NAM) held in Atlanta, Georgia on June 8-13, 2025. NAM29 will provide a venue for graduate students to meet other graduate students, interact with leaders in catalysis, and integrate into the catalysis community. This will help inspire and promote the professional development of these future research leaders. \r\n\r\nCatalysis researchers from across North America and the world will gather for this premier conference to present and discuss research on a number of topics related to catalysis, including electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, catalytic hydrocarbon chemistry, CO2 conversion, reaction engineering, applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to catalysis, and more. The NAM29 conference typically has over 1000 talks, many presented (both oral and poster) by graduate students. Many of these students are supported by the Kokes Travel Award. Students attending the NAM29 conference will have opportunities to learn of the latest research in catalysis, and also network with their peers, possible mentors, and future employers. Such interactions promote students becoming better integrated into the catalysis community. Such efforts also help ensure a strong pipeline of future catalysis leaders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
