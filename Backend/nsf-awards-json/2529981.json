 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering 2025 (QCE), sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and scheduled for August 31st\u2013September 05th, 2025 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA, is an event that brings together a diverse group of participants, including researchers, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, developers, students, practitioners, educators, and programmers. It bridges the gap between the science of quantum computing and the development of an industry surrounding it. The conference serves as a multidisciplinary forum for discussing the challenges and opportunities in quantum computing, networking, and engineering. \r\n\r\nThis proposal provides travel support for approximately twenty undergraduate and graduate students in the United States to attend this premiere conference. The travel awards recognize the importance of conference participation in their educational journey and addressing the often-limited availability of travel funds. This initiative is beneficial not just for the students, but also for the broader research community and the Quantum Information Science and Engineering workforce, as it fosters the development of new talent and brings fresh perspectives to the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
