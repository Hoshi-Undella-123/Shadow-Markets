 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. National Academy of Sciences will continue its support of the activities of the Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics (CAA). Using the astronomy and astrophysics decadal surveys, the CAA identifies issues of concern to the astronomy and astrophysics community and provides guidance to federal agencies regarding their astronomy and astrophysics research programs in order to encourage the field\u2019s scientific progress. The committee membership itself is drawn from experts across the astronomy and astrophysics disciplines and as such is able to identify and assess issues and trends which impact the broader multidisciplinary arena.\r\n\r\nThe CAA has a broad impact by acting as an established forum to bring together leading researchers from the scientific community and representatives from across the federal government to discuss emerging research needs and opportunities for the advancement of astronomy and astrophysics. In each ad hoc study that the CAA initiates and oversees, the committee places an emphasis on accessibility by the layperson and promoting the public understanding of science. By identifying cross-cutting issues and/or opportunities, the CAA can enhance the research and education environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
