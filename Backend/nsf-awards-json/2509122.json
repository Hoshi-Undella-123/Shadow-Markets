 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of undergraduate students enrolled at HBCUs so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of this project is to provide high-impact research experiences that implement curricular enhancement in biology by incorporating innovative partnerships and developing research experiences that enhance students\u2019 understanding of the STEM workforce at Delaware State University. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to accomplish this goal by 1) engaging a cohort of early-sequence students in research internships within the department of biological sciences at DSU during the academic year, and 2) leveraging the partnership with the Wistar Institute to adapt two courses for the biology curriculum at DSU, Biomedical Research Methods and Life Science Innovations. The proposed activities will provide students with increased technical skills, enhanced written and oral scientific communication, expand their mentoring and networking communities, and develop lasting relationships within the scientific community. The expected outcomes of this project will offer best practices toward implementing innovative high-impact experiences that will improve students\u2019 knowledge and enhance readiness and preparation for the STEM workforce. By equipping students with these advanced skills, the project has the potential to contribute to the expansion of the nation\u2019s skilled STEM workforce in biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
