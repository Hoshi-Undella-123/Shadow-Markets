 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research in this project investigates the costs of eviction and homelessness.  Analysis of several large data sets and experimental methods are combined to study four aspects of eviction and homelessness: (i) the cost of eviction for children; (ii) whether short-term emergency rental assistance leads to long-term housing and economic stability; (iii) whether preventative measures to avoid homelessness are effective in the short- and long-runs; and (iv) whether the eviction court system can be modified to reduce eviction and homelessness.  The research results can lead to reduced homelessness and help establish global leadership in reducing homelessness.  The integrated education plan includes training in housing economics.  \r\n\r\nFour experimental projects and analysis of linked administrative data sets are used to study the short- and long-term effects of eviction and homelessness on families. The first project examines the costs of eviction on children with particular emphasis on causal evidence on the impact of eviction on children\u2019s housing, academic achievement, and long-run employment and earnings. The second project uses a field experiment to study the effects of short-run housing assistance on long-run benefits for tenants. The third project investigates whether services to reduce homelessness are effective, and whether households experiencing housing crises can be diverted from homeless shelters with financial assistance. The fourth project uses a field experiment to test the hypothesis that the timeline to vacate after eviction is a driver of homelessness.  This research advances knowledge of the link between homelessness, neighborhoods, and intergenerational mobility, and inform the design of measures to reduce homelessness.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
