 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Delaware to acquire a 600 MHz solid-state dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) system to enable research across various scientific disciplines. This new instrument will significantly enhance the scientific infrastructure in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and \u201cRust Belt\u201d regions by providing access to unique DNP nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) capabilities for cutting-edge scientific discoveries. The instrument will serve as a vital regional resource for numerous academic and industrial partners, facilitating the development of new collaborations and driving innovative projects. Access to this state-of-the-art technology will provide exceptional training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral students. The outreach program includes a rich array of societally beneficial activities aimed at sharing advanced NMR capabilities with the broader community, increasing public awareness of NSF-funded research, and contributing to the development of an effective and highly skilled STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThe science enabled by the new spectrometer will impact multiple fields, including chemistry, chemical and biomolecular engineering, fundamental biophysics, NMR spectroscopy, structural biochemistry, molecular cell biology, material sciences, biotechnology, and marine sciences. The significant sensitivity enhancements achieved in DNP experiments will facilitate the investigations of a wide variety of systems previously inaccessible with current instrumentation, such as intact cells or organisms, macromolecular assemblies, polymers, biologics, highly complex organic mixtures, surfaces, and engineered materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
