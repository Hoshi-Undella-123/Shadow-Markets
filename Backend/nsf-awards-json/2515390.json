 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2025 Tropical Cyclone Operations and Research Forum (TCORF), the 78th Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference (IHC) will be held on March 3-7, 2025, at the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center, Lakeland, Florida. Topics will include research addressing operational imperatives, challenges in observing and forecasting during the 2024 hurricane season, Hurricane and Ocean Testbed and Joint Technology Transfer Initiative activities, along with other research projects. A meeting of the Working Group for Tropical Cyclone Operations and Research, which supports the annual update of the National Hurricane Operations Plan, will be a part of the forum.\r\n\r\nAt the TCORF/78th IHC, representatives from Federal agencies and the academic research community will have the opportunity to discuss the latest research into tropical cyclone observing, forecasting, and warning such as:\r\n1. 2024 hurricane/typhoon season challenges and the opportunities for research that they offer.\r\n2. Research priorities of the operational centers.\r\n3. Observations and observing strategies.\r\n4. Tropical cyclone model development.\r\n5. Transitioning research to operations.\r\n6. Advances in tropical cyclone forecast and warning products and services.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is important to the United States because it brings the academic research community and hurricane forecast operation community together with federal agencies, to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season and make improvements to the US hurricane forecasting and warning program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
