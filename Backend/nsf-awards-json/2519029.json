 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the growing national demand for a quantum computing (QC) workforce equipped not only with theoretical knowledge but also with practical skills in programming, system design, and cyberinfrastructure (CI). By integrating AI powered tutoring, immersive visualization tools, and hands-on experience with cloud accessible quantum platforms, the project aims to promote the progress of science and strengthen national competitiveness in emerging quantum technologies and improve preparedness of learners with varied academic training. The openly shared educational resources and outreach strategy facilitated by a network of experts will support long term workforce development and broaden access to quantum education as well as ensure that the benefits extend well beyond the host institution.\r\n\r\nThe long-term goal of this research team is to support a strong foundation for Quantum Computing Applications and Systems CI learning and workforce development. To achieve this goal, two investigators leverage their expertise in quantum computing, system, visualization, and cyberinfrastructure, to develop an integrated framework: 1) a modular quantum training platform that integrates a tiered curriculum, progressing from foundational quantum principles to system and application development, also couples these courses with designed engaging activities together with collaborating institutes to broaden participation. 2) an AI tutor powered by a fine tuned large language model that provides automated feedback and personalized guidance. 3) an interactive visualization framework that pairs analogy based mappings of core quantum phenomena with object based augmented reality scenes and gesture controlled interfaces. Together, these efforts deliver a reusable, scalable, and research aligned training platform that couples rigorous instruction with experiential learning and state of the art visualization, positioning participants for leadership in the national quantum workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
