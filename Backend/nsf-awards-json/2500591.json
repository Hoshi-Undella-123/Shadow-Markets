 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity, that collect and share data. AIoT refers to the fusion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) that merges the data-gathering abilities of IoT devices with the analytical strength of AI algorithms, resulting in systems that are both smarter and more efficient. There is a cybersecurity skills shortage in IoT, which has hindered innovation and growth in the northern Virginia region. The goal of this project is to address the cybersecurity skills gap at the two-year college level. This work will enhance NOVA\u2019s cybersecurity program by introducing cutting-edge AIoT cybersecurity education to prepare students for employment in the cybersecurity industry, which will help meet workforce needs in the Northern Virginia region.\r\n\r\nThis project represents an innovative approach to addressing the skills and knowledge gaps in the cybersecurity field and is poised to make a significant impact on the region\u2019s cybersecurity education and workforce development. The primary objectives of the program are: (1) designing and developing an AIoT cybersecurity curriculum with hands-on labs and industry-certification alignment; (2) designing projects to teach students technical analyses of selected IoT devices; 3) mapping the course to existing programs for sustainability and expanded availability, and 4) develop and implement a replicable mentoring and outreach program to increase participation in cybersecurity programs. Mapping new courses to existing programs ensures long-term sustainability and the potential for expanded availability beyond the initial implementation at NOVA. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
