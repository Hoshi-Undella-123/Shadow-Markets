 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates a new approach to quantum photonics by leveraging specialty optical fibers, originally designed for telecommunication, as compact platforms for advanced quantum information encoding. By exploring these fibers at visible wavelengths, where they behave differently than their design specifications, the project opens new possibilities for encoding quantum information using both spatial and particle properties of light. This work addresses the national interest by advancing foundational science in quantum technologies which are key areas for future secure communication, precision measurement, and quantum computing. In addition to scientific advancement, the project fosters interdisciplinary education, providing hands-on training for students in quantum optics, integrated photonics, and machine learning-based data analysis. Public outreach activities, in collaboration with the Buffalo Amateur Astronomy Association, will further broaden public understanding of quantum technologies.\r\n\r\nTechnical Project Description\r\nThe proposed research aims to explore the use of interacting ring-shaped multicore optical fibers (MCFs) at visible wavelengths to develop new hybrid quantum encoding schemes. Operating these telecom-grade fibers outside their design parameters at visible wavelengths enables the investigation of spatial mode structures for quantum light which is an area largely unexplored. By integrating MCFs with quantum light sources and photon-counting detectors, the project will demonstrate encoding of quantum information in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, essential for scalable quantum communication and computing. The research involves simulations of quantum dynamics in MCFs, experimental validation of hybrid qudit-based encoding, and real-time machine learning-based photon classification. Additionally, the project will study inter-core coupling dynamics to realize quantum random walks and Boson Sampling in a fiber-based platform. These experiments aim to demonstrate new architectures for near-term quantum advantage. This exploratory effort will lay the groundwork for scalable, low-loss, fiber-integrated quantum devices, representing a paradigm shift in quantum photonic integration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
