 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation improvement grant investigates public engagement with science and technology at large scale events such as fairs, expos and trade shows. The study will assess the potential of megaevents to serve as forums for advancing and engaging the public with science and technology in public spaces.  The results of this study will be of benefit to decision-makers, planners, science center and museum curators, and event facilitators who convene members of the public to engage in scientific activities and plans.\r\n\r\nThis work will assess the potential of megaevents for public engagement in conversations about the role of science and technology. It will examine the content and techniques used in megaevent exhibits in order to answer the following research questions: 1) What stories are told at megaevents about science/technology?, 2) How is public engagement facilitated?, and 3) Who participates in megaevents? This mixed-methods research project will collect data from promotional materials, interviews, field research, and visitor-uploaded videos to identify effective means for public engagement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
