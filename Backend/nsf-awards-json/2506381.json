 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to revolutionize metal additive manufacturing by developing innovative acoustic molding technology addressing supply chain vulnerabilities while enabling manufacturing capabilities. Current metal 3D printing processes require expensive equipment, materials, and extensive post-processing, limiting adoption to large enterprises creating foreign dependencies. This project targets the metal additive manufacturing market by offering a solution operating in standard electrical environments without high-powered lasers or metal powders. The innovation enhances scientific understanding by demonstrating contactless acoustic manipulation of molten metals, enabling multi-material printing capabilities like aluminum-copper hybrid components previously impossible to manufacture. The technology provides competitive advantages through material recyclability, performance with reflective materials challenging laser-based systems, and faster print speeds through molten metal deposition versus powder methods. The proposed business model focuses on direct sales with small machinist shops as the primary beachhead market, followed by research institutions and facilities including dental and medical device producers. This democratizes metal additive manufacturing while strengthening domestic production capabilities and reducing supply chain dependencies. The technology serves national interests by enabling prototyping, reducing material waste, and supporting manufacturing competitiveness in aerospace, automotive, and medical applications.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of using ultrasonic phased arrays to control and solidify molten metals during additive manufacturing processes. The research addresses challenges in 3D printing, including supply chain disruptions, material waste, limited alloy compatibility, and post-processing requirements. The project objectives focus on establishing metallurgical dynamics under acoustic influence and evaluating acoustic field behavior across thermal conditions. The proposed research employs a hemispherical array of ultrasonic transducers to generate controlled acoustic fields capable of confining molten metals without physical contact. Initial experiments will utilize low-temperature eutectic alloys to characterize acoustic manipulation parameters, followed by high-temperature testing with aluminum and copper alloys. The research methodology includes implementing advanced control systems for phased array, developing computational models based on modified acoustic potential equations, and integrating feedback mechanisms. Anticipated technical results include achieving submillimeter spatial accuracy, maintaining material density exceeding 99%, demonstrating surface finish quality, and faster deposition rates through direct molten metal printing versus layer-by-layer powder methods. The approach overcomes reflectivity limitations of laser-based systems with reflective metals and enables multi-material deposition. Success will establish scientific principles for acoustic molding and provide foundation for next-generation additive manufacturing systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
