 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 53rd annual Canadian Operator Theory Symposium (\"COSy\") (May 26-30, 2025) and the inaugural \"Operator Algebras and Quantum Information\" conference (June 2-6, 2025), will be held at the University of Waterloo, Canada. These conferences concern recent research work in two areas of mathematics known as operator algebras and quantum information theory. Both areas are deeply intertwined through decades of parallel research, and they have far-reaching implications in mathematics, physics, and computer science, as well as the eventual implementation of quantum technologies. Funds from this award will provide an excellent opportunity for US-based researchers, to present their own research findings in these areas internationally, making use of the geographic advantages of conferences in North America and the strong interconnectedness of mathematics research in the United States and Canada. These conferences also serve to attract new researchers to the field as both areas of research continue to grow.\r\n\r\nThe first conference (COSy) has had a long history of success in cultivating research in operator theory and operator algebras (the mathematical theory underpinning the area of quantum information). The second conference is new and addresses a growing need for established venues for scientific interaction between researchers in operator algebras and those in quantum information theory (which often uses some amount of operator algebras as a mathematical description of the problems considered). In a time where quantum information is becoming more prevalent in theory and implementation, and the need for cross-discipline research grows, these conferences aim to be a bridge between the two areas of operator algebras and quantum information. Information about the conferences can be found at https://www.cosy2025.ca and http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/24-25/operator-algebras-quantum-information.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
