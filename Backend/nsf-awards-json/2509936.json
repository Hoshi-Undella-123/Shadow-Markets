 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant supports the acquisition of a 250kN-capacity universal testing machine (UTM) for interdisciplinary research and educational and outreach activities at the University of Guam. Research into the resiliency of civil infrastructure such as buildings, bridges, and roads and the sustainability of construction materials is significantly needed for remote US areas including Guam. This instrument will be used to conduct testing of infrastructural materials and structural components to understand their performance and determine relevant design data. Tests conducted by the UTM will be integrated into the curriculum for undergraduate courses and will play a major role in research training, STEM summer camps, and workshops for teachers, industry practitioners, and K-12 students. The UTM will become an important resource in workforce development for Guam and neighboring regions, specifically for gaining material and structural testing experience and qualifications. The instrument will enhance the research productivity of the University of Guam, boost industry collaborations, and foster innovation in the region.\r\n\r\nThe 250kN-capacity Universal Testing Machine will facilitate research and training in the areas of structural engineering, construction materials, mechanical engineering, and additive manufacturing. The instrument offers the capability to perform tests on material samples and full-scale structural components of plain concrete, steel bar-reinforced concrete, fiber-reinforced polymer composites, fiber-reinforced concrete, structural steel, timber, and hybrid structural elements. The instrument will be used to carry out test-to-failure experiments on small- and full-scale structural elements such as beams, short columns, and slabs and determine the failure mechanism that describes the structural behavior of the element. The instrument has built-in high precision input channel that acquires important data including load, displacement, or strain at failure. These data will be used to validate analytical and finite element models that can help inform building codes, design guidelines, and standards. The equipment will be an important resource for researchers and students, supporting collaborative and multidisciplinary studies and enhancing research infrastructure at the University of Guam and neighboring regions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
