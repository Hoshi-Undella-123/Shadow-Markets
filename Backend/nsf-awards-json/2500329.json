 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) EPSCoR Graduate Fellowship Program (EGFP) supports EGFP designated institutions and programs in EPSCoR jurisdictions by providing funding for graduate fellowships for new or continuing EGFP-eligible applicants. EGFP awards support a total of three years of stipend and associated cost-of-education (COE) allowance for each NSF EPSCoR Graduate Fellow.\r\n\r\nThis award at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology will support twelve EPSCoR Graduate Fellows with funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) EPSCoR Graduate Fellowship Program (EGFP). This support is aligned with goals and programs within NSFs Directorate for Engineering (ENG) and Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO). This project will support graduate students who earned an Honorable Mention in the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) to pursue ground-breaking research in developing new materials for broad scientific and engineering applications. These applications include biomaterials that provide more targeted and effective release of drugs for patients with cancer and other conditions, thin films that improve the efficiency and sustainability of generating ammonia and hydrogen products to improve crop productivity and improve resource conservation, and new polymers that can serve as eco-friendly alternatives to petroleum-based plastics. The project will also advance quantum materials capable of revolutionizing the fields of computing, communications, and sensors. The students will engage in advanced multidisciplinary research, equipping them with the skills to drive transformative technology solutions through innovative materials. This training will prepare them for impactful careers in both industry and academia, fostering a workforce capable of leading the development of next-generation materials and pioneering new industries. The ability to recruit and support these talented students will enhance research productivity at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and foster establishment of patents and startup industries, thereby contributing to the economic development of local, regional, and national communities.\r\n\r\nInterested Honorable Mention applicants will apply for this opportunity through the NSF Education and Training Application (ETAP) system. Selected Fellows will be admitted and paired with faculty from four well-established graduate programs that lead research and manage active grants in innovative materials. In addition to ground-breaking research, joint team-building and professional development activities will be planned between participating departments to build a strong cohort of graduates with broad understanding of materials innovation across multiple disciplines. Fellows will collaborate on research activities at the university and at multi-institutional research centers in the state, leveraging and strengthening recent, current, and planned EPSCoR R-II, E-CORE, E-RISE, and the National Institute of Health COBRE initiatives. Fellows will be encouraged to take advantage of programs offered by SDM\u2019s Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, including the NSF Great Plains Region I-Corps Hub, the SDM Entrepreneurs-in-Residence program, and the South Dakota Governor\u2019s Giant Vision Business Competition to promote commercialization of innovative materials developed by their research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
