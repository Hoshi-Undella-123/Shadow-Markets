 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference showcases innovative approaches to science-informed decision making across disciplines such as AI, quantum computing, and other innovative technologies. As the complexity of public challenges increases in areas such as cyberattacks, an aging population, and geopolitical competition, governments must modernize how they deliver services, spur innovation, and respond to the threats facing the USA. The conference promotes the progress of translating academic insights into actionable solutions for these challenges. It supports national welfare by equipping decision-makers and early-career researchers with frameworks to deliver more efficient and responsive services. \r\n\r\nAt the conference early-career researchers and students present their work on using scientific advances in areas such as AI and quantum computing to inform decision making to deal with current challenges. Attendees also interact with STEM professionals engaging in decision making. In addition to providing training, the project yields publicly available materials including summaries of presentations and recorded sessions designed to benefit educators, students, and the public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
