 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Texas A&M University-San Antonio, located in San Antonio TX, will support the training of 8 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2026-2028. It will recruit from A&M-SA, local community colleges, and four-year institutions nationwide, including students that lack access to research experiences. The REU-INSPIRE program will assess whether engaging students in community-based research focused on local, national, and regional issues can enhance student recruitment and retention in STEM. Students will work on long-term projects addressing the effects of human activity in a region grappling with challenges of both local and national significance, and identify possible solutions and strategies. This area will serve as a \u201cliving laboratory\u201d where students will gain hands-on skills and workforce-relevant experience while collecting data on ecosystem health, biodiversity, and environmental chemistry by monitoring changes over time. They will also have opportunities to present their findings to the community, increasing the impact and reach of the research. Assessment of this program will be done through surveys and online tools. Students should apply to the REU site using NSF ETAP (Education and Training Application: https://etap.nsf.gov). \r\n\r\nOur distinguished interdisciplinary faculty mentors from Biology, Chemistry, and Water Resources Science and Technology are studying the impact of development on the Espada property, a multi-acre site co-managed with the San Antonio River Authority. Research projects include surveillance of emerging microbiota in water, monitoring stormwater quality, and assessing dietary changes in local lizards due to temperature fluctuations. By expanding student involvement in these research initiatives, INSPIRE will contribute to recruiting and retaining the next generation of STEM students. Participants will develop a strong understanding of STEM fields, preparing them to be informed and capable of recognizing the importance of STEM in addressing complex, large-scale challenges. Students will be trained in responsible conduct of research, hone their ability to communicate their findings with varied audiences, and enhance their teamwork capabilities. This project will be a model for integrating research and education to support national workforce development initiatives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
