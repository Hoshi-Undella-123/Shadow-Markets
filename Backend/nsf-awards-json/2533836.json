 "awd_abstract_narration": "The workshop: \"Workshop on Physics of Biological Aging\" will explore the role of physical science in advancing the field of biological aging. The field is in need of new, integrative concepts and bringing together physicists and biologist will bring novel ideas in this important research effort. The workshop would have approximately 22 participants (21 confirmed) chosen from both sides of the biological science/physical science divide and meet in Paris for several days in September 2025. This effort would be the latest in a series of such workshops aimed at extending the reach of the Physics of Living Systems community and providing a publicly available perspective for students (and faculty members) for getting started on aging research. \r\n\r\nThe meeting is scheduled to occur in early September with approximately 22 participants. These will be drawn both from leaders in the biology of aging research community and from the PoLS community of physical scientists. The meeting will last for two days and explicitly consider how to move forward using advanced ideas from physics, mathematics, and computer science (including of course on AI using deep learning). The organizers plan for a follow-up article presenting the results of the discussions to the NSF, the physics and biology community as well as to the general public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
