 "awd_abstract_narration": "Viruses are the most abundant biological organisms on our planet. While all microbial populations are impacted by viral infections, little is known about the impact of viral infections on specific microbial populations. The consequences of virus\u2013microbe interactions on biogeochemical cycles are also poorly understood. This project focuses on sulfate reduction, a key process that links the global elemental cycles of carbon and sulfur. The research aims to understand the relationships between viruses and sulfate reducing bacteria and how these interactions contribute to carbon cycling. This project also supports STEM workforce development through experiential learning activities at K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels. The training activities highlight research on the Gulf coast and how the Gulf is a unique environment. In addition, the education activities emphasize the importance of sulfate reduction and other geochemical processes and showcase the importance of microorganisms in coastal ecosystems. The project aims to change the negative view of viruses as agents of diseases by highlighting the essential roles of viruses in ecosystem processes.\r\n\r\nThe project uses a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the relationship between viral activity and sediment microbial metabolism, specifically sulfate reduction, through environmental observations, process-oriented biogeochemical incubations and modeling. This research provides novel insight into the interactions between viruses and microorganisms, and how they control early diagenetic processes by (i) determining the impact of viruses on sediment metabolism in general, (ii) quantifying the influence of viruses on microbial sulfate reduction rates, (ii) elucidating the interactions of sulfate reducing microorganisms and viruses. These results are being incorporated into a reactive transport model to describe viral dynamics and their interactions with the C, S, and Fe cycles. The model forms a framework to integrate the observational data and provides a tool for estimating the broader implications of the targeted virus-microorganism interactions quantified in the sulfate reduction zone.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Biological Oceanography and Chemical Oceanography Programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
