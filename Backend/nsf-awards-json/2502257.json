 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experience for Teachers (RET) Site project at the University of Nevada, Reno, will provide STEM educators (grades 6-14) with immersive research experiences in the cutting-edge field of Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI). Edge AI, which involves processing data directly on local devices rather than in centralized cloud systems, is a transformative technology critical for future advancements in areas such as autonomous systems, smart cities, and advanced manufacturing. By equipping teachers with first-hand knowledge and research skills in Edge AI, this project aims to address the urgent national need for a technologically skilled workforce and to enhance the quality of STEM education. The project will empower educators to inspire their students by bringing authentic, state-of-the-art computing and engineering concepts into their classrooms, thereby promoting scientific progress and contributing to the nation's economic prosperity and technological leadership. This initiative will directly benefit society by fostering a deeper understanding of AI among future generations and strengthening the pipeline of talent prepared for the challenges and opportunities in rapidly evolving high-tech fields. \r\n  \r\nThe primary goal of this RET Site is to provide Nevada teachers with a strong foundation in Edge AI principles and engage them in hands-on research using SmartEdge, a custom-designed, transferable Edge AI testbed. The research will focus on areas including machine learning, Internet-of-Things (IoT), robotics, and cybersecurity, with projects tailored to explore real-world applications such as smart IoT devices, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. Participating teachers will work alongside faculty mentors and graduate students to develop research projects and subsequently translate these experiences into novel K-14 curriculum modules aligned with state educational standards. The project scope includes intensive six-week summer research programs, year-round support for curriculum implementation, and activities designed to build a collaborative community of STEM educators. This approach will not only provide teachers with valuable research experience but will also generate new educational materials and pedagogical strategies, contributing to the broader understanding and integration of Edge AI concepts in K-14 STEM education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
