 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project investigates the commercial potential of a needle insertion system for interventional radiology. Each year, hundreds of thousands of image-guided needle procedures are performed in the United States, and this number is steadily increasing. Mistakes or delays in these procedures can lead to higher costs and poor outcomes for patients. Several pain points have been identified within the current field of interventional radiology; these include: high cost, lack of robotic solutions, and concerns with radiation exposure. These problems are especially important because many hospitals perform image-guided procedures every day, and as the number of these procedures continues to grow, the needle insertion system targets a large and growing need in healthcare. By enabling faster and more precise needle placement, the system can reduce overall procedure time, which contributes to lower operational costs. In addition, shorter procedures mean reduced radiation exposure for staff, supporting both economic efficiency and a safer clinical environment.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a piezoelectric-actuated robotic system for image-guided, minimally invasive procedures. The system is designed to operate safely within magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environments and features seven independent axes of motion powered by non-magnetic piezoelectric motors. The technology achieves precise needle placement by using closed-loop control algorithms that respond in real time to imaging feedback, adjusting the needle trajectory during the medical procedure with millimeter-level accuracy. This accuracy represents a significant advance over conventional manual techniques and existing robotic systems that rely on open-loop control, that do not adapt to real-time changes in needle position or tissue interaction. The primary goal of the system is to improve the safety, consistency, and efficiency of interventional radiology procedures. By minimizing needle misplacement and reducing the need for repeat imaging, the system lowers procedure time, decreases radiation exposure for clinical staff, and enhances patient outcomes \u2014 ultimately contributing to more effective care.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
