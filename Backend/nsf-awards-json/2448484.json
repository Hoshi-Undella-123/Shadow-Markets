 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Noyce Track 1 project aims to prepare highly qualified secondary STEM teachers in the state of New Mexico. The project will support 12 scholars in biology, chemistry, computer science, and mathematics; the recruitment of undergraduate STEM majors will take place at both New Mexico State University and Dona Ana Community College. The key components of the project, including near-peer mentoring and several clinical experiences within the public schools and the New Mexico State University STEM Center, will enable high-achieving prospective teachers to become secondary STEM teachers with relevant content and pedagogy expertise. \r\n\r\nThis project will be iteratively evaluated. First, the recruitment and retention of Noyce scholars will be evaluated. Second, the effectiveness of key project components, including clinical experiences and near-peer mentoring, will be evaluated for the ways in which they contribute to teacher preparation. The results of this project will be disseminated to help enhance the field. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
