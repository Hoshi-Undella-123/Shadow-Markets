 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to provide travel scholarships for 10-15 students to attend and present their work at the 15th International Conference on Fundamentals of Adsorption, FOA15 held in Porto, Portugal, on May 18-23, 2025. This conference will provide many opportunities for graduate students to network with other graduate students, interact with leaders in the community. These connections will encourage and promote the professional development of these future research leaders. \r\n\r\nThis conference will include comprehensive coverage of the spectrum of fundamental research and applications of adsorption, ranging from molecular modeling and simulation of fluids adsorbed in porous materials to the design of pressure swing adsorption systems for industrial gas separation processes. The attendees represent a wide range of academic disciplines, including chemical engineering, chemistry, physics, and materials science and engineering, among others, and the level of industrial participation is high. Awardees will be chosen based on a nomination letter from their PI and their submitted abstract for their presentation. Research in these topical areas has far-reaching societal implications, including mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and reducing industrial energy consumption.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
