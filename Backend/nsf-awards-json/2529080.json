 "awd_abstract_narration": "Along with the emergence of actual quantum computers, quantum computing is expected to transform science, technology, and society by solving problems intractable for classical computers, including those in chemistry, materials, and finance. However, existing quantum computers face a major obstacle: their results are often unstable over time and difficult to reproduce; this is primarily because of the fluctuating noise in the environment. The stability challenge exists across different qubit technologies, including superconducting qubits, trapped-ion qubits, and neutral atom qubits. To address this pressing challenge, the Quantum System Stability and Reproducibility Workshop (StableQ) was established at the Quantum Week 2023, a conference sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), followed by its second edition at the IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO) in 2024. The third edition, StableQ 2025, is scheduled to be held in September 2025 at IEEE Quantum Week at the Albuquerque Convention Center in New Mexico. \r\n\r\nThis award will support students and researchers to participate in StableQ 2025. The project will bring together experts from academia, industry, and national laboratories to report state-of-the-art developments, exchange ideas and practices, and foster cross-disciplinary research aimed at addressing unstable noise and enabling reproducible quantum computing. The workshop is uniquely positioned to foster collaborative efforts by bringing together experts from hardware, software, and algorithms to tackle key stability issues. Through interactive sessions, participants will identify challenges, prioritize research directions, and address gaps between academia, industry, and national laboratories. Ultimately, this project aims to develop novel techniques, strengthen collaborations in the research community, and deliver scalable, stable, and reproducible quantum computing platforms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
