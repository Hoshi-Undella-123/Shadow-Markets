 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the West Coast Discrete Probability and Combinatorics conference at the University of Washington on July 17-18, 2025.  The conference is designed to provide opportunities for graduate students and junior researchers to interact with top experts in the field and for them to learn about some of the most active research areas in mathematics. Each day of the conference features ten 20-minute talks. The short talks will allow graduate students and early-career researchers to present their work. The conference will also provide several informal sessions for researchers to interact outside of the talks in order to help  researchers build networks of people with similar interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of the conference is combinatorics, probability, and the interactions between these two fields. Among the topics  are permutations and random walks. The conference focus is on building connections and encouraging interactions between the probability and combinatorics communities.\r\n\r\nThe meeting website is at https://www.coinflippers.org/coin-flippers-2025\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
