 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) face many barriers to fully engage in the research enterprise. Nationwide, PUIs enroll millions of students and fill a critical role in educating the future U.S. workforce. Faculty-mentored undergraduate research, often funded through faculty external grants, helps recruit and engage students, while also providing hands-on experiences for success in the workforce. However, local and national surveys reveal that faculty members at PUIs suffer a significant burden in managing the administrative tasks associated with external grants, which often discourages the pursuit of grant-funded research. This project will serve as a model to promote a dynamic research-oriented culture that ensures faculty have support to pursue and manage externally funded projects, resulting in increased grant proposals and funding, which will ensure undergraduate students have greater access to mentored research experiences that enhance their academic and workplace success.\r\n\r\nTo address research enterprise challenges at PUIs, this project has the following three objectives: 1) Introduce the \u201cpost-award research concierge\u201d position and develop a model training program at two Universities of Wisconsin (UW) PUI institutions. 2) Partner with the National Council of University Research Administrators for a first-of-its-kind system-wide peer review. 3) Create a Community of Practice with representatives from the 11 UW PUIs that will prioritize and address peer review findings and other relevant topics. Outcomes will include improved faculty satisfaction with sponsored programs services, increased faculty capacity and engagement in research and grant seeking, increased research expenditures, and increased undergraduate student research participation due to increased grant funding. The project will result in multiple models that can benefit the research enterprise, which will be disseminated regionally and nationally through a robust dissemination plan.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
