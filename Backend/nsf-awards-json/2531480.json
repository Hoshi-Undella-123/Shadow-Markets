 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lower ionosphere, located between 85 and 140 kilometers above Earth's surface, is a dynamic region where the atmosphere transitions from cold neutral air into a plasma-rich environment. Here, high-speed winds, rapid density changes, strong electric currents (called electrojets), and aurora borealis all interact to create irregularities\u2014disturbances in the plasma density.  These impact electrical currents flow, the plasma temperatures, and, perhaps most importantly, how radio travel moves through the upper atmosphere, sometimes disturbing GPS and a variety of communications. The broader impacts of this work extend beyond ionospheric science. This project has strong educational and training components. It will include mentoring undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge plasma physics and space science. The tools and simulation techniques developed can be applied to other areas of plasma research, and the open availability of these resources will support a wide community of scientists. Ultimately, this research will contribute to better models of Earth's upper atmosphere, improve our ability to interpret remote sensing (such as from radars) and rocket data, as well as train the next generation of space physicists.\r\n\r\nThis research project aims to better understand the physical processes behind these plasma irregularities by using high-resolution computer simulations, theory, and comparisons with observations. These simulations will model conditions in the ionosphere more realistically than previous efforts, accounting for vertical variations in conductivity and the turbulent effects of space weather events such as geomagnetic storms. This research will combine simulations with theoretical models to better predict how these irregularities evolve over time and impact the larger ionosphere. A key goal is to improve how scientists interpret radar and satellite data that monitor Earth's space environment. By refining both computer and theoretical models, the research will support more accurate forecasting of how the upper atmosphere responds to external forces like solar storms. This is particularly timely, as new missions such as NASA\u2019s Electrojet Zeeman Imaging Explorer (EZIE) and a forthcoming international campaign in Peru will be gathering detailed observations of these electrojets.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
