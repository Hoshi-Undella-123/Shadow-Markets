 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over three years, this project at Atlantic Cape Community College will prepare 60 students for high-demand careers in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) by developing a comprehensive degree option and a one-year certificate program. These programs will equip students with the commercial applications of AI technologies to thrive in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Serving the Atlantic and Cape May county regions, the initiative will increase access to AI technologies education. Students will benefit from a curriculum that will efficiently prepare them for employment in the AI field. They will earn stackable credentials in the field and can complete a certificate/degree in 12 months. By collaborating with local industry leaders, the curriculum will align with workforce demands, ensuring that students graduate job-ready to contribute to the AI-driven economy. The significance of this project lies in its potential to increase participation in the STEM workforce, drive regional economic growth, and prepare students to address challenges in emerging AI technologies.  \r\n\r\nThis project will establish a new AI and ML degree option and a one-year certificate program, building on the existing Computer Programming Associate of Applied Science degree. The goals include designing and implementing four new courses focused on machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and AI ethics. These will be introduced progressively, starting with foundational concepts in the first year and advancing to specialized topics in the second year. Students will participate in a capstone project in partnership with local industries, showcasing their work at an annual exposition. Faculty associated with the program will benefit from professional development that will train them on state-of-the-art equipment and innovative pedagogical methods. The faculty will complete externships with industry partners, gaining real-world experience that will be integrated into the curriculum through updated techniques and authentic case studies. The advisory council, led by the Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT), will actively guide curriculum development. This project will advance the understanding of AI workforce preparation by broadly recruiting students, offering stackable credentials, and evaluating the effectiveness of revised teaching methods and experiential learning opportunities. This effort is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program, which supports technician education for advanced technology fields critical to the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
