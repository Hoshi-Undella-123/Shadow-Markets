 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award will provide partial support for US participants to attend the conference \"A meeting in Poisson Geometry\", to take place March 6-9, 2025, on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis.  A meeting in Poisson Geometry conference is a series of regular meetings in North America where mathematicians interested in Poisson geometry and their applications meet and discuss new ideas and results. It provides opportunities for mathematicians at all career stages to present their work and propose directions for future research. \r\n \r\nA meeting in Poisson Geometry conference series was established in 2011 as a conference focusing on Poisson geometry and their applications. This year, the thematic focus of the conference is Poisson geometry, Lie groupoids, and index theory. It will consist of 4 50-minute plenary lectures, as well as 15-20 30 minute contributed talks. Topics will include several areas of active current interest in Poisson geometry, emphasizing recent developments and emerging directions in Lie groupoids and index theory. Additional details are available at https://sites.google.com/view/gonefishing2025/home\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
