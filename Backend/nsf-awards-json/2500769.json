 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by enhancing community college education in remote sensing technologies to address the critical skills gap in the Built Environment (BE) sector. The project will develop innovative curricula, courses, and advanced certificates that prepare students for careers utilizing remote sensing technologies, such as drone operations and advanced data processing techniques. By fostering sustainability, efficiency, and technological literacy, this initiative aligns with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science, while supporting the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program's goal of training technicians for high-demand fields. Its broader significance includes addressing national workforce demands, enhancing student employability, and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration in BE careers.\r\n\r\nThe project will focus on developing and implementing industry-aligned curricula, including stackable certificates, tailored to the specific needs of the BE sector in Southwest Ohio. Project goals include integrating remote sensing technologies into coursework, equipping students with cutting-edge skills in drone operations, LiDAR, and geospatial analysis, and fostering partnerships with local industries to align training with workforce demands. The project will assess the effectiveness of the developed curricula, evaluate student outcomes, and disseminate results through academic publications and industry collaborations. By addressing the evolving needs of the BE sector, the project will generate new knowledge and practices, contributing to the field's broader understanding of how to align education with technological advancements. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
