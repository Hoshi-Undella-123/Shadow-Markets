 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a novel, cost-effective alternative to traditional, expensive nitrogen removal technologies in agricultural waste management. The project has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of concentrated animal feeding operations, improving water quality, and contributing to ecosystem health. The solution also helps farmers comply with regulations, lowering the cost of waste management, and alleviating the financial burden of off-site nitrogen treatment. The technology targets farmers and can potentially reduce annual waste treatment costs by 60%. This solution could have a lasting positive impact on water quality nationwide.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This technology is based on the pervasive problem of nitrogen runoff from animal agriculture, which contaminates water bodies and poses significant environmental and regulatory challenges. Unlike existing high-cost, infrastructure-heavy systems, the technology uses a solar-powered, passive filtration mechanism to remove 99% of nitrogen from manure lagoons at a fraction of the cost. The technology's reliance on microbial systems and solar energy offers an alternative to traditional methods. Additionally, the device's low production cost and ease of maintenance represent a significant advance, providing a cost-effective means for small to mid-sized farms to comply with regulations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
