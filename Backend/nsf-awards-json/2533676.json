 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for early career scientists to take part in a symposium at the annual Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) meeting in January 2026. SICB is the leading society for interdisciplinary biology research from molecules to whole organisms. The symposium speakers will present cutting-edge research that integrates perspectives from ecology, physiology, and evolution to understand behavioral responses to the environment. In addition to presenting research, early career scientists funded through this award will participate in workshop discussions, develop their professional networks, and exchange ideas that advance research and move the field forward. \r\n \r\nThis award supports the participation of early career scientists in a symposium examining behavioral responses of organisms to the environment. The symposium brings together researchers studying behavior from ecological, physiological, morphological, and evolutionary perspectives in order to identify and synthesize data and build an integrative, comprehensive understanding of behavioral responses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
