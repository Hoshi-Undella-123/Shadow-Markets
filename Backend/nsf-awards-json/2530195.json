 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research computing stakeholders have grown to consider The Practice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing (PEARC) Conference series as a forum for discussing challenges, opportunities, and solutions specific to research computing. Also, the consistent growth in data and the ubiquity of research instruments has increased the array of research areas that rely on advanced research computing. Thus, access to reliable, robust and resilient high-performance computing (HPC) resources as well as data solutions is no longer a luxury, but an expectation and requirement for researchers to stay competitive in their domain. \r\n\r\nHighly skilled individuals are needed to facilitate computation and accompany users in their usage of research computing tools. Thus, the theme for this year\u2019s PEARC conference is \u201cThe Power of Collaboration\u201d. Building on the success of the XSEDE and PEARC conference series, this year\u2019s conference aims to highlight the role and importance of the power of collaboration while broadening the community by introducing the next generation to the world of Research Computing. The conference exposes students and scientists to professional networks and other resources that facilitate research workforce development. Students are paired with mentors from a community of experts, who provide support and networking opportunities at and beyond the conference. Research presentations and lightning talks are additional opportunities available to attendees. PEARC25\u2019s program offers students with a unique opportunity to gain hands-on-experience in advanced research computing and encourages them to pursue a career in it.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
