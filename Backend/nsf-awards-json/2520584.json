 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a centralized digital platform designed to enhance the management of transportation asset data. Transportation agencies across the United States grapple with outdated and fragmented data systems that hinder efficient asset management and strategic decision-making. These challenges result in increased operational costs, reduced infrastructure reliability, and potential risks to public safety. This digital platform addresses these significant challenges by offering a unified solution that integrates asset data across various lifecycle stages, including planning, construction, maintenance, and rehabilitation. A unified approach not only simplifies and streamlines the data management process but also facilitates greater visibility, accountability, and efficiency within state transportation agencies. By adopting this solution, state agencies can better align their practices with federal regulations, thereby reducing unnecessary costs and improving the overall effectiveness of infrastructure investments. The social and economic benefits include enhanced public safety, improved infrastructure reliability, and substantial cost savings through optimized asset management.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a comprehensive digital asset management platform that incorporates an integrated four-step framework \u2013 define, organize, strategize, and execute \u2013 to streamline data governance across the transportation asset lifecycle. The platform distinguishes itself from existing solutions by providing flexibility tailored specifically to the unique operational and technological requirements of state transportation departments. Technically, this platform advances current capabilities by employing targeted data collection strategies to avoid data overproduction, and to maintain high-quality, actionable insights. The approach integrates previously siloed systems, enabling consistent data standardization, and improved interoperability. By addressing these technical and operational barriers, the technology enhances strategic planning and operational efficiency. Users benefit directly from improved data accessibility and precision, enabling more informed, proactive decision-making and resource allocation, thus enhancing overall infrastructure management effectiveness and public safety outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
