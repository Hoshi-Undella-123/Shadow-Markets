 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project led by North Dakota State University will build a strong and sustainable STEM community across North Dakota. Collaborating institutions include Cankdeska Cikana Community College, Mayville State University, Minot State University, Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College, Sitting Bull College, Turtle Mountain College, United Tribes Technical College, University of North Dakota, and Valley City State University. The project will focus on connecting researchers across North Dakota, improving STEM opportunities in rural areas, and facilitating STEM education for students at tribal colleges. It will address the lack of STEM opportunities in rural communities, challenges faced by students at tribal colleges, community colleges, and primarily undergraduate institutions, as well as the barriers posed by distance between research institutions. By creating new partnerships between schools, colleges, and universities, the project will increase opportunities for STEM education and careers. It will promote hands-on learning, social connections in STEM education, and opportunities for students from across the state to succeed. It will also bring researchers together to solve important problems. The project will measure its success through detailed evaluations and aims to leave a lasting impact by creating new educational pathways, stronger research networks, and a more skilled STEM workforce in North Dakota. \r\n\r\nThis project will establish a comprehensive and sustainable STEM ecosystem in North Dakota through three targeted focus areas: Administrative Core, STEM Pathways Core, and Tribal Colleges & Universities Core. The project team will connect geographically dispersed researchers, enhance STEM literacy among rural communities, and strengthen STEM participation at tribal colleges. The team will use targeted strategies to mitigate barriers, such as limited rural opportunities and geographical isolation. Through interdisciplinary research networks, expanded STEM outreach, and relevant educational programming and research, the project team will foster collaboration across North Dakota institutions, broaden participation in STEM, and enhance educational and workforce outcomes. Partnerships between universities, tribal colleges, and rural schools will ensure enduring impacts, including heightened research capacity and a stronger STEM workforce. Key metrics, longitudinal evaluation, and sustainability plans will guide the project's progress, aiming to create a thriving STEM landscape that aligns with North Dakota\u2019s strategic goals. This project is supported by the Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) Program: EPSCoR Collaborations for Optimizing Research Ecosystems (E-CORE). E-CORE supports jurisdictions in building research capacity and research infrastructure to drive substantive and sustainable impacts to their research ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
