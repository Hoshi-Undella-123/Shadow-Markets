 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports U.S.-based participants in attending the workshop \"Connections between Commutative and Non-commutative Harmonic Analysis,\" to be held at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS) in Edinburgh, UK, during the week of September 1\u20135, 2025. The workshop aims to bring together senior and early-career researchers working in commutative and non-commutative harmonic analysis. Although these fields share deep connections, their communities rarely have the opportunity to meet at conferences of this scale. The workshop will provide a unique environment to present recent advances and exchange expertise. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will focus on four central topics in harmonic analysis: matrix weights, Fourier multipliers on (non-abelian) groups, vector-valued harmonic analysis, and martingale-related techniques. It will begin with four plenary mini-courses on these themes, delivered by leading experts. The workshop will also feature invited long and short talks by researchers working around these core topics. In addition, there will be contributed talks and a poster session to provide more opportunities for graduate students and early-career researchers to present their work. More information can be found at https://www.icms.org.uk/CommutativeandNonCommutativeHarmonicAnalysis\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
