 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving curriculum in geospatial education augmenting it with artificial intelligence and other advanced geospatial tools. Advancing Geospatial Workforce Preparation intends to support the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based skills by (1) integrating them into the geospatial curriculum through course modifications and (2) enabling twenty-four (24) students to further develop these skills through research opportunities and hybrid internships. The project will showcase ways in which traditionally hands-on instruction in technical skills can be adapted to an immersive online environment. The hybrid nature of the internships is innovative, includes online support from project personnel, industry, and GIST graduate mentors during the virtual phases as well as host, faculty, and mentor support when performing field work.\r\n\r\nThe workforce demand for Geospatial Information Science Technology (GIST) technicians with advanced geospatial AI and cloud-based geospatial skills is increasing rapidly across the nation. Advancing Geospatial Workforce Preparation will strengthen GIST curriculum in advanced GIST courses with AI, cloud-based GIS, mobile GIS, and other advanced geospatial tools in five credit bearing courses at Monroe Community College (MCC): Introduction to Remote Sensing, Web Mapping, Geospatial Data Acquisition and Management, Geospatial Programming, and the Geospatial Capstone Course. New curriculum modules, developed with industry support and adapted from the most current guidance available for GIST curriculum development, will enable the graduates to advance GIST knowledge in many industries that are seeking to modernize their operations. MCC GIST alumni will work with small cohorts of students in introductory classes to improve retention and success, provide career guidance for students in the advanced GIST courses, provide drop-in tutoring for students, and support students during the hybrid internship. The new curriculum will also prepare students for paid internships with organizations using the latest in GIST tools. Students will be recruited into the program through a broad outreach program that utilizes the latest in social media as well as more traditional approaches while engaging local high schools in several of the recruiting initiatives. As one of the first community colleges in the nation to offer a completely online GIST micro-credential, GIST Certificate, and GIST A.A.S. degree, this project will enable students to develop the advanced AI and cloud-based GIST skills that are increasingly important in the GIST workforce. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
