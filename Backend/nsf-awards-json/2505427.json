 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semiconductors are important building blocks in today's electronics. They drive technological innovations in fields such as transportation, telecommunication, health care, and defense. Semiconductor manufacturing plays a critical role in fueling innovations and sustaining economic growth. This IRES project creates a mechanism to engage U.S.  undergraduate STEM students in semiconductor manufacturing research in Taiwan. By leveraging the expertise and resources of the project partners in Taiwan, the summer research internships include an intensive semiconductor short course and a 4-week research immersion at National Chung Hsing University in Taichung, Taiwan. The project engages students in international research collaboration, develops their research skills, and enhances their global fluency, adaptability, and intercultural knowledge. Innovation and leadership in the semiconductor industry require a highly skilled workforce. This IRES project provides students with experiential learning opportunities to build international research networks and helps cultivate globally engaged future leaders to ensure the competitiveness and long-term success of the U.S. semiconductor industry.\r\n\r\nThe IRES semiconductor short course comprises topics from fundamental principles to advanced fabrication of semiconductors, such as semiconductor physics, semiconductor materials, thin film technology, nanolithography, and packaging and testing. The research immersion projects focus on advancing scientific knowledge by addressing critical areas that impact performance, efficiency and scalability in semiconductor manufacturing. These projects investigate important topics such as (1) quantum transport and phase transitions in heterogeneous nanomaterials, (2) electronic states of transistor devices in 2D materials, (3) resonator qubit frequencies and transmission line impedance of flip-chip architecture, (4) effects of fabrication processes on surface morphologies of semiconductors, and (5) multielement doping approach to enhancing catalytic efficiency for sustainable manufacturing. Under the guidance of a research mentor, each participating student is integrated into the mentor's research team to conduct independent research. Professional development activities are organized throughout the summer internship and post-travel follow-up program. Through the IRES project activities, students develop leadership, communication, and lifelong learning skills that are critical for successful global engagement in semiconductor manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
