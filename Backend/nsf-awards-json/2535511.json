 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks a travel grant to support student attendance at the 2025 Embedded Systems Week (ESWEEK) in Taipei, Taiwan. ESWEEK is a premier international event that unites leading conferences in embedded systems and software, covering critical advancements in compilers, architectures, hardware/software codesign, and embedded software development. Supporting student participation in ESWEEK directly serves the national interest by fostering the next generation of innovators in a field crucial for advancing technology, prosperity, and welfare. Increased student attendance will enrich the conference and help attract students from all background to embedded systems and STEM research. Students will gain unique opportunities to interact with global experts and industry leaders, discuss their research, and establish connections vital for their professional careers. This initiative aims to address financial barriers that often prevent students from attending, thereby ensuring a more skilled workforce for the future of embedded systems.\r\n\r\nThe project's goal is to provide travel support for approximately 30 eligible students to attend ESWEEK 2025. Eligibility is restricted to undergraduate or graduate students currently enrolled at a U.S. university, including U.S. citizens traveling from other countries. Priority for funding will be given to students presenting their research work at ESWEEK, its symposia, and workshops, with a special preference for U.S. citizens and permanent residents. The grant will cover a portion of reimbursable expenses, including airfare (on U.S.-flag carriers or ticketed through U.S. carriers), ground transportation, lodging, registration fees, and meals. Outreach for travel support will be widely advertised through the ESWEEK website, mailing lists, and technical society newsletters. Student applications will be collected via email, requiring a resume, a cover letter detailing reasons for attending and estimated expenses, and an advisor's letter supporting the application and stating other funding availability. A committee will select awardees based on eligibility, participation level, research alignment, advisor recommendation, and prioritizing U.S. students. After the event, each awarded student must submit a one-page report on their impressions and outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
