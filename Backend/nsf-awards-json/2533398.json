 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Equivariant, Motivic, and Physical Topology in the Midwest\u2019' will take place October 24-26, 2025, at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.  This conference will bring together leading researchers working in a wide array of different aspects of algebraic topology.  Topology \u2014 the study of the intrinsic properties of geometric objects \u2014 has found broad application in recent years in other branches of mathematics such as geometry and the study of symmetries, as well as in high energy physics.  This conference will promote the continued interactions of these disciplines through a series of lectures by experts as well as providing a venue for collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe conference will focus on equivariant homotopy theory, motivic homotopy theory, physics, and symplectic topology pertaining to physics. There has been ongoing progress at the intersection of these fields, and these interactions have been fruitful for both the development of theory and the advancement of computations. The invited speakers are on the forefront of the recent developments in these fields, and their work highlights the intersections.  Further details, including the program and speaker information, will be available on the conference webpage at https://cse.umn.edu/math/events/equivariant-motivic-and-physical-topology-midwest. After the conference, this website will be used to post the recorded talks, to allow the broader community to benefit from our scientific program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
