 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Hilbert Function Spaces 2025\" will be held June 30-July 4, 2025 in Frascati, Italy, at a facility that belongs to the University \u201cTor Vergata\u201d of Rome. The purpose of the meeting is for distinguished researchers in the field of Operator Theoretic Function Theory to share their recent progress during the plenary talks, for participants as a collective to work out the \u201cstate of the art\u201d of the field, and to establish new collaborations among the participants. Funds from this grant will primarily be used to support the conference travel of US based early career mathematicians.  Participation in this conference will facilitate the integration of these individuals into the international research community in analysis, and it will inform and inspire their research and teaching efforts as they return to their home institutions in the US.\r\n \r\nThe conference will be an interdisciplinary workshop on Operator Theory, Function theory, and Harmonic Analysis, and their applications and interactions with other fields. These topics in pure mathematics are important parts of the foundations of the mathematics necessary for our modern digital devices such as cell phones and imaging devices, but they are also important in many other areas such as optimization and quantum physics. Information of the conference can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/hfs2025/home .\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
