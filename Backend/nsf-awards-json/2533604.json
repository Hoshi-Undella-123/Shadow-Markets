 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to fund US-based students to attend 2025 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Smart Systems (MASS), held in Chicago, Illinois on October 6 - 8, 2025. IEEE MASS is a premier annual forum for sharing original, novel ideas in mobile ad-hoc and smart systems.\u202f The conference brings together researchers, developers, and practitioners to address recent advances in mobile ad-hoc and smart systems, covering algorithms, theory, protocols, systems & applications, experimental evaluations and testbeds, security and privacy, as well as AI/ML-based smart design.   \r\n\r\nThis project supports students from US universities to attend IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Smart Systems (MASS) 2025 in person. Students will have the opportunity to present their work and be exposed to state-of-the-art developments in the field. They will also have the opportunity to interact with peers from institutions worldwide, meet with senior researchers, and participate in discussions that are likely to shape the future of the field. This grant will target students who will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited travel funds. Priority will be given to first-time attendees.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
