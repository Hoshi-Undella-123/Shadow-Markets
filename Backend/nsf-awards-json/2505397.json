 "awd_abstract_narration": "This IRES project supports the International Grid Research and Advanced Training in Energy (InteGRATE) program, which prepares U.S. students to solve modern energy challenges through training locally and abroad. The program is led by the University of Memphis and includes a partnership with Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (TUM) in Germany. Students participate in hands-on energy research, attend workshops, and receive mentorship from experts in the U.S. and Europe. They explore how different countries manage energy systems, including electricity, heating, and transportation. Through this experience, students improve their technical skills, gain global perspective, and learn how policy and infrastructure affect energy decisions, preparing them for global leadership in the evolving energy sector. \r\n\r\nStudent participants engage in research focused on modeling, control, and validation of distributed and interconnected energy systems, with the goal of improving their performance, flexibility, and resilience. Areas of investigation include energy storage optimization, microgrid operation, integration of hydrogen technologies, and the development of dynamic virtual power plants (DVPPs) - systems that manage decentralized energy resources in real time. The InteGRATE program combines simulation and experimentation by leveraging the University of Memphis's power-hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) testing facilities and advanced modeling tools, alongside TUM's Center for Combined Smart Energy Systems (CoSES), which provides a unique platform for testing sector-coupled systems that link electricity, heat, and mobility. Through this collaboration, students work with real-world data, test advanced control strategies, and explore how energy systems respond under different policy, infrastructure, and market conditions. By addressing both technical challenges and broader contextual factors, the InteGRATE program prepares students to contribute meaningfully to the design of future energy systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
