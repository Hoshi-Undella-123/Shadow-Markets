The Physical Metallurgy GRC is a key network- and community-building event for all metallurgists and materials scientists, from graduate students, post-docs, and other early career scientists, to senior scientists and engineers.  The unique format of Gordon Research Conferences with: in-depth presentations at the forefront of science with equal time for discussion; integrated poster sessions where all attendees, regardless of their career levels, are encouraged to present their work; and informal discussion sessions and workshops, provide a forum to probe our scientific understanding and share knowledge and expertise. The 2025 Physical Metallurgy GRC is subtitled \u201cMetallurgy to Enable Next Generation Engineering\u201d, reflecting the community\u2019s commitment to the principles of the National Science Foundation\u2019s efforts to support fundamental science that will lead to a better future for generations to come. The GRC will be preceded by an associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) where early career researchers present and discuss their work and participate in mentoring and career-building activities. The GRS will be held on July 5-6, 2025 and the GRC will be on July 6-11, 2025, at Stonehill College in Easton, MA. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOne of the most pressing challenges and opportunities for the physical metallurgy community lies in our ability to harness the latest scientific advances to have positive impacts on the environment, economy, and society. The community must learn to design, produce, and implement metals and alloys in a rapid and sustainable manner. Therefore, the principal research objective of this meeting is to explore the complex relationships between processing, structure, properties, and performance that are needed to overcome acute barriers to discovery and implementation of sustainable metals in a wide range of applications. Advances in physical metallurgy are needed to enable forward-looking concepts in light-weighting, recycling, extreme environments, magnetic/energy applications and others. The technical approach for this meeting will focus on the fundamental scientific underpinnings (material defects, thermodynamics, kinetic interactions and microstructure) necessary to achieve these goals. The oral and poster sessions at the GRC and GRS will provide a robust venue for discussion of the fundamental science advances, methods, and tools, with the anticipated outcome of providing a vision for using physical metallurgical sciences to enable discoveries. The impact of the meeting will be realized through the engagement of the research community to harness the dialogs of the meeting toward accelerating design and development of advanced metallic materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
