 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project expands training in nanopore sequencing to better prepare students for careers in the U.S. bioscience industry. Nanopore sequencing is an advanced biotechnology method used by employers in industry, government, and academia to analyze DNA or RNA from biological samples. As demand for this technology grows, so does the need for skilled biotechnicians who can apply it in real-world settings. To address this need, the project develops best practices for workforce education and hands-on training in nanopore sequencing. Outcomes are shared widely as a scalable, adaptable model for bioscience training programs across the country.  \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to develop two nanopore sequencing-based mini-course undergraduate research experiences and two industry-certified nanopore sequencing micro-credentials. Through the mini-course research experiences, students in biotechnology and bioscience programs engage in authentic, student-driven research using industry-level nanopore sequencing technology and bioinformatics tools. For the micro-credentials, a business and industry leadership team provides guidance to identify the specific nanopore sequencing skills most valued in technician-level job candidates. Students receive workforce training in these skills, and their competency is certified through the newly developed micro-credentials. Student, instructor, and industry feedback is collected through direct observation and survey questionnaires based on these pilot experiences, and that feedback is used to refine and enhance the nanopore sequencing mini-CUREs and micro-credentials before nationwide dissemination. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
