 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site awarded to South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, located in Rapid City, SD, supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2025-2027.  In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), the students will participate in interdisciplinary research projects, alongside professional development activities to prepare students for post-graduate work and careers in science and engineering. The program aims to address the emerging challenges in the domestic lithium supply chain, energy storage, and more efficient technologies. \r\n\r\nThe program emphasizes interdisciplinary research in chemistry, biochemistry, materials chemistry and environmental science.  Strong focus is placed on sustainability and green chemistry. Participants will be recruited from colleges with limited research opportunities in the West and Midwest EPSCoR regions. By providing hands-on research training and generating knowledge to advance sustainable and more efficient technologies, the Li-SMART REU site aims to prepare students to tackle global challenges in resource security and sustainability, while also contributing to a skilled STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
