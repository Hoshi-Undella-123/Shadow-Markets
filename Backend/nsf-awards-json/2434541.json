 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Polar Geospatial Center (PGC) at the University of Minnesota supports scientific research in the polar regions. PGC distributes high-resolution optical imagery, made available via the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, to U.S. Government-funded polar scientists. Its wide array of services includes satellite imagery, topographic maps and educational content. PGC\u2019s activities provide essential support for field operational activities, such as expedition, route and facility planning. The data provided by PGC also aid expansive studies documenting the evolution of the Earth\u2019s cryosphere, supporting research in glaciology, geology, geophysics, and Earth System science. Examples of innovative imagery techniques and products that are made possible by PGC include: Digital Elevation Models for both polar regions, mapping seasonal changes of sea ice coverage and dynamics of continental ice sheets, quantifying meltwater on the ice sheet surface in Greenland and Antarctica, preparing detailed topography maps and permafrost changes, identifying actual coastlines masked by ice or meltwater, impacts of extreme weather events for polar atmospheric and ocean studies, watching polar flora seasonal changes and climate-driven ecosystem shifts, and even counting vertebrate (e.g., polar bears, penguins, etc.) populations. \r\n\r\nPGC facilitates scientists' access to geospatial resources and respective domain knowledge by providing the following products and services to the polar community: (1) Access to sub-meter resolution satellite imagery of all locations poleward of 60\u00b0 latitude in each hemisphere, and the ability to request new imagery targets for commercial satellite cameras; (2) Access to high-resolution topographic models generated as part of ArcticDEM and the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA), which document the morphology of the Earth\u2019s surface as a function of time; (3) Discipline knowledge of geospatial and computational techniques to help solve challenging problems at high-resolution over continental scales; and (4) Educational content via online materials that provide researchers with tools needed to advance science and promote modern best practices of geospatial data processing. PGC is also a source of public geospatial data that empowers researchers, educators, and others from outside the National Science Foundation polar community to investigate the current understanding of Earth surface processes. By developing rapid data access interfaces, PGC has made substantial advances in more directly and efficiently connecting its users to the data they need. Continued advances in rapid data delivery will make PGC services more responsive to the dynamic work done by its vast user community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
