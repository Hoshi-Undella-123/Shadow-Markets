 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal Research Experience for Teachers (RET) site at the University of South Alabama will support middle and high school educators in an interdisciplinary research experience in bio-inspired computing systems. Through cutting-edge research projects and the development of standards-aligned curricular materials, the site will enhance teachers\u2019 knowledge of and pedagogical skills in bio-inspired computing systems. The highly structured research projects span emerging technology applications such as data imaging, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, and microelectronics hardware. The project also includes a \u201cteachers mentoring teachers\u201d component, in which prior participants will serve as mentors and teacher leaders in the research training, curricula development, and classroom implementation. In addition, the site builds upon successful partnerships with local school districts, research facilities, and AI industry leaders to provide a holistic experience of emerging technology pathways in Alabama. \r\n\r\nThrough this RET renewal site at the University of South Alabama, 27 middle and high school teachers will participate in a six-week summer research program to enhance their knowledge of and pedagogical skills in teaching bio-inspired computing systems. Technical innovations to be developed by the RET participants, as well as the research team, will include: (i) novel imagery collection techniques and image processing algorithms for cancer detection; (ii) new AI algorithms to classify and visualize the collected imagery data; and (iii) new memristor device-based bio-inspired system design for enhanced efficiency. The summer program will also include immersive curriculum development activities. Extensive follow-up activities will be offered in the academic year through on-site visits, follow-up workshops, and support community to ensure the translation of RET experience into classroom instructional practice. This project will empower a workforce of teachers with knowledge in bio-inspired computing systems and transdisciplinary teaching methods, which will enable them to prepare their students for the fast-paced digital era.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
