 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pombe2025 meeting, scheduled to be held at Boston College in Boston, MA, from August 3-8, 2025, will bring together researchers who focus on Schizosaccharomyces pombe and other fission yeasts. This international conference will cover a wide range of topics, including cell cycle regulation, genome stability, gene expression, metabolism, and cell polarity\u2014key areas for understanding cellular processes and their connection to human diseases. The meeting will feature keynote talks by prominent scientists, interactive panel discussions, and poster presentations. Graduate students and early-career researchers will have the chance to showcase their work and engage with both peers and senior scientists. This meeting will contribute to our understanding of essential cellular and molecular processes that are conserved across different species. Research on fission yeast frequently has far-reaching implications for the field of biology. The meeting's interdisciplinary nature will encourage connections across various fields of study.  \r\n \r\nThe International Fission Yeast Meeting influences more than just Schizosaccharomyces pombe research. Major discoveries in areas such as cell division, DNA repair, and chromosome segregation have significant implications for our understanding of fundamental biology and human diseases, including cancer and genetic disorders. By bringing together experts from a range of fields\u2014such as genetics, molecular biology, cancer research, and systems biology\u2014the meeting promotes interdisciplinary collaboration. This exchange of knowledge often leads to innovative approaches that benefit not only fission yeast research but also broader biological and medical advancements. Furthermore, the meeting plays a critical role in the development and mentorship of young scientists. It offers students and postdoctoral researchers a platform to present their work, interact with established experts in the field, and gain insights that will shape their future contributions to molecular and cellular biology. The event will foster collaborations that lead to scientific breakthroughs and long-term progress within the broader scientific community by strengthening global research networks. Funding will be allocated to provide travel awards for domestic trainees, promoting broad participation in the event.\r\n\r\nThis award is cofunded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function program and the Genetic Mechanisms program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
