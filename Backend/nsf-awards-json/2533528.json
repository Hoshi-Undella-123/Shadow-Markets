 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is a mentoring event hosted at the ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software\r\nfor Humanity (SPLASH). SPLASH is a premier venue in programming languages and software engineering (PL/SE) research which focuses on all aspects of software construction and delivery. PLMW provides early-career researchers, such as undergraduate students, Masters students, and early PhD students, the opportunity to learn about PL/SE research, develop skills towards navigating the practical elements of graduate school and career finding, and start developing meaningful connections with the research community at large. Support through this grant facilitates the free exchange of technical information and the development of an engaged, global research community by facilitating the in-person presence of US-based students.\r\n\r\nThis grant provides travel and conference registration support for US-based students to attend the mentoring workshop and conference from 2025 to 2027 in three different regions of the world: Singapore, the United States, and Europe. Priority for funding will be given to students who are first-time conference attendees and demonstrate strong interest in pursuing PL/SE research careers. PLMW expects to support 20 students through this grant.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
