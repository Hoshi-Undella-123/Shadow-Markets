 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a customized membrane-based solution for industrial water reuse with a focus on cooling tower blowdown water (CTBW).   CTBW is is the portion of water that is discharged from a cooling tower system to remove excess dissolved solids, minerals, and impurities that accumulate due to evaporation.  This project will manufacture membranes with specific chemistry that will enable the reuse of CTBW. The membranes will allow for the reduction of CTBW volume and reduce water consumption in cooling towers.  This is particularly important given the increased need for cooling in data centers, buildings, power plants, and manufacturing facilities and could expand the available location of these facilities into regions with less water available.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will support the scaling of the electrohydrodynamic spray to make a 2 square meter membrane that will be used in commercial-scale systems. This element will be a commonly used form factor for the water treatment industry and be implementable in current treatment systems.  These membranes will be tested under real conditions using real CTBW water and operational challenges will be assessed for membrane fouling, cleaning, and longevity.  This project will enable the building of first large-scale spray system, or printer, that will make this testing possible.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
