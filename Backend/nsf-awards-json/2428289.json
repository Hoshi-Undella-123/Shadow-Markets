 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to culture three-dimensional groups of cells while monitoring their characteristics is a critical issue in biomanufacturing. Addressing this issue will improve the study of disease, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine to treat the world\u2019s aging population. This Future Manufacturing project will fund research to develop new sensing technologies for use in 3D cell cultures using cells from the nervous system. These technologies build on advances in the semiconductor and microelectronics industry. The project will train a new workforce in life sciences and engineering, with a focus on device design and fabrication. The University at Albany will partner with SUNY Polytechnic Institute\u2019s engineering technology program and community college partners Hudson Valley Community College and Bronx Community College to develop a skilled workforce able to work in the biotechnology industry. A middle school outreach program will teach students about STEM with demonstrations of robotic cars controlled by electrical signals sent from the brain to muscles. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop manufacturable 3D mammalian cell culture systems focusing on neural organoids with incorporated sensing technologies. This project looks to address challenges related to: the limits of manufacturability of scaled-down sensing devices, the capacity to introduce photonic and electronic sensing devices in 3D culture systems, and the integration of photonic hydrogels that support cell growth and improve sensing. To address these challenges, the project has the following research objectives: (1) build and test conformal microelectrode arrays (MEAs) to interrogate neural organoids and transition these conformal MEAs from lab scale to flexible electronics manufacturing; (2) develop photonic-based sensors to detect small molecule metabolites using DNA aptamers as sensing devices; (3) optimize production of photonic hydrogels for pressure and strain sensing and integration with silicone nitride photonic devices. In parallel with these research activities,  this project will engage in workforce development activities consisting of: outreach to middle school summer camps to inform students of career opportunities in manufacturing that integrate life sciences, engineering and human health; technical training combining life science manufacturing, engineering, and device design; and development of novel hands-on curricula for a Humanitarian Engineering Technology minor to benefit engineering technology students through exposure to life-science topics.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems, Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation, and Division of Engineering Education and Centers in the Directorate for Engineering, and the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
