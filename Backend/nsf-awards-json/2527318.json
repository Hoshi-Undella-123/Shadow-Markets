 "awd_abstract_narration": "Power outages during severe weather or infrastructure failures can disrupt schools, emergency response, and daily life in many parts of the United States. This project investigates how electric school buses (ESBs), when equipped with bidirectional charging technology, can serve as distributed energy assets to improve local grid stability. While ESBs are primarily used for student transport, their stationary periods and onboard battery capacity present a novel opportunity as an on-grid portable energy hub. Recharge-OK is co-led by a team of academic researchers and civic partners including Shawnee Public Schools, Oklahoma Gas & Electric, and regional planning entities, etc. The project will be implemented in Shawnee, Oklahoma, through coordinated efforts among engineers, utility professionals, and school officials. It seeks to demonstrate how existing public-sector assets can enhance infrastructure resilience without requiring large-scale capital investments. The anticipated outcomes include improved preparedness for grid disruptions and new operational models for school transportation fleets. This work supports the National Science Foundation\u2019s mission by advancing applied research in energy systems and demonstrating innovative use of public infrastructure to address nationally relevant challenges. The results may inform future deployments across other municipalities and contribute to broader efforts in infrastructure resilience and evidence-based energy planning.\r\n\r\nThis project will deploy a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system using electric school buses and bidirectional chargers at Shawnee Public Schools. The technical objectives are to: (1) develop a predictive energy management system (EMS) that optimizes charging and discharging based on grid demand, weather forecasts, and transportation schedules; (2) evaluate system performance using metrics such as peak load reduction, dispatch latency, and backup energy duration; (3) assess battery degradation under real-world V2G cycling conditions; and (4) develop a decision-support platform that integrates operational data and simulation outputs. Civic partnership is central to the project. A Community Advisory Board (CAB) comprising school representatives, utility professionals, city officials, and other civic partners will co-guide implementation, ensuring alignment with local needs and operational realities. Engagement activities will include school-based demonstrations, workshops with transportation staff and utility operators, and ongoing input from civic stakeholders. These efforts will support practical deployment and help develop a scalable model that balances technical feasibility with community priorities. This research will generate new insights into the technical feasibility, reliability, and operational value of ESBs as mobile energy storage assets. Findings will inform future scaling, policy design, and investment strategies related to distributed energy integration in public-sector applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
