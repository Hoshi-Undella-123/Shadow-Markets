 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Noyce Track 1 project aims to serve the national need of preparing highly qualified STEM teachers in the state of Delaware and the surrounding region. The proposed project components will enable high-achieving prospective teachers to become STEM teachers working in area schools. This project at Delaware State University includes partnerships with Capital School District and the Early College School at Delaware State University. Project goals include producing 10 highly qualified teachers over 5 years in STEM subjects spanning biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics, drawing from both STEM undergraduates and post-baccalaureates. \r\n\r\nEvaluation of the project will be guided by the following evaluation questions: (a) Which program strategies contributed to recruitment and retention of teacher scholars and (b) How do participants experience the supports provided by project faculty and activities as they learn to become effective teachers? The results of this project will be disseminated to help enhance the field. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
