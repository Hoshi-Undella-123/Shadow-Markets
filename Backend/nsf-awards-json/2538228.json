 "awd_abstract_narration": "This series of conferences and convenings is focused on advancing knowledge that has direct application to pressing societal problems for keeping communities safe and healthy in the face of a growing number of weather-related risks. A wide range of health issues are weather related such as respiratory issues due to poor air quality, heat stress, impacts on water quality from flooding, and others. There are many reasons for the weather community to work closely with the medical/health communtity to keep people safe and healthy. While there are examples of effective collaborations between the weather and health communities, much more could be done to provide the medical researchers and practitioners with information to reduce health impacts from weather. This set of meetings brings together key professionals from academia, the profit and non-profit sector, and other interested parties to foster effective collaborations to accelerate the understanding links between weather and health. Those collaborations, and the research that will result from them, will ultimately lead to new products and services that improve the safety and health of the public. Broader impacts of the work will provide education and training of early career professionals seeking careers at the intersection of weather and health to build a strong and well integrated community of practice in this area of societal need.\r\n\r\nThis series of convenings involves virtual and in-person meetings. The in-person discussions take advantage of existing American Meteorological Society meetings that bring together many of key stakeholders that are essential to contribute to project goals. A Steering Committee of leaders working at the intersection of weather and health guide the formation of active working groups that explore issues such as data and metadata standards to allow the interoperability of health and weather datasets; consistent health reporting information; and new approaches to education and training of professionals working at the intersection of weather and health. The Steering Committee and working groups set the agendas for the three in-person meetings. These will involve scientists and professionals from government, academia, and the private, and NGO sectors in weather information and services. They will also include health and medical professionals whose job is to keep communities safe and healthy. The in-person meetings include one at the American Meteorological Society (AMS) Annual Meeting in January 2026. This national meeting has over 5000 attendees, many of whom work at the intersection of weather and health. Another is the AMS Washington Forum in April, 2026. This convening brings together thought leaders from government and the  academic, private, and NGO sectors. The last formal in-person meeting will happen just before or after the AMS Summer Community Meeting in August, 2026 where collaboration across the weather enterprise is facilitated and emphasized. Virtual working groups will also convene in the interim between in-person meetings to enable conversations between all interested parties on a variety of weather and health related issues. These convenings are designed to result in new and/or expanded collaborations to foster high-impact, action-oriented interdisciplinary research between those in the weather and health communities with a goal of advancing and accelerating our how to better address issues impacting human health in a rapidly changing and increasingly unpredictable weather present and future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
