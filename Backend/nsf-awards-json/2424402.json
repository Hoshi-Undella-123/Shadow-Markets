 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Texas Tech University. A total of at least 36 scholars pursuing BS degrees in electrical engineering and computer engineering will receive scholarships of up to $15,000 per year for three years. Scholars will receive faculty and semiconductor industry focused mentoring, and the project will build strong scholar cohorts through experiential learning such as hands-on semiconductor manufacturing experiences. Additional activities for scholars include personalized, AI-informed career preparation support, industry-informed mentorship, laboratory training, and academic and professional mentoring. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this Track 2 Scholarships in STEM project is to increase STEM degree completion of academically talented, low-income undergraduate students with demonstrated financial need. There is a significant national need to grow the STEM workforce and nurture key talent that will ensure economic competitiveness and provide domestic leadership across critical sectors. This project directly speaks to this need by supporting STEM student success, which will strengthen the workforce in the semiconductor industry and other key areas of need. The project will be assessed by an experienced evaluator that will help the team gain knowledge (e.g., access to academic and professional development resources, learning gains and learning gaps, industry engagement, etc.) about the specific needs of these high-achieving, low-income students, and the data generated will contribute to the knowledge base regarding effective strategies to support students in STEM. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of academically talented, low-income students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
