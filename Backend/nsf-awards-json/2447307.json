 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU Site: Robotic Pioneers and Extreme Environments offers a transformative 10-week research experience in advance robotics technologies for extreme environments, including GPS-denied areas, underwater settings, and space exploration. Each year, ten REU students will engage in research that addresses the critical challenges encountered by robots operating in harsh conditions. Participants will engage in research projects that focus on developing innovative solutions for autonomy and control, removing the need for humans to enter hazardous environments. Students will undertake individual research projects under the mentorship of expert faculty and graduate mentors, complemented by hands-on team activities such as designing and competing with robots. Beyond technical research, participants will build leadership and communication skills through STEM outreach initiatives and professional development sessions. Participants will not only expand their technical expertise but also gain the confidence and skills to make meaningful contributions to the rapidly evolving field of robotics. The program will expand participation in robotics by actively recruiting students from across the US. By cultivating the next generation of engineers and equipping them for pursuing graduate programs and potential careers in robotics and autonomous systems, the engineering workforce will be able to better address current and future societal challenges. \r\n\r\nOne goal of this project is to develop accomplished engineers who are confident innovators in the robotics and autonomy communities. By providing in-depth education and research experiences to undergraduates, the project will provide opportunities for participants to deepen their knowledge and understanding about robotics systems and to consider pursuing graduate studies and potential careers in robotics related fields. Students will engage in four key activities: conducting individual research projects to gain a deep understanding of a specific robotics area, participating in a hands-on team project to build and compete with maze-running robots, teaching robotics to younger students at a STEM camp, and attending professional development activities, seminars and workshops, to prepare for future academic and professional pursuits.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
