 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a widely recognized, reliable, and sustainable energy source, offshore wind (OSW) has been rapidly deployed around the world. However, the OSW development in the U.S. is still in its infancy. The current electric energy infrastructure in the U.S., as well as the enabling technologies, are not well prepared for an efficient transmission and integration of large-scale OSW, which is preventing the U.S. from playing a critical role in leading this global technology transformation. To this end, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), in collaboration with Rowan University, will conduct planning activities towards establishing a Center for Grid Enhancing Technologies for Offshore Wind Transmission and Integration (GOWIND). GOWIND aims to establish a strategic research and education hub focused on driving technological innovation, creating partnerships, and advancing workforce training to enable the sustainable development of the nation\u2019s OSW industry. With strong support from industry partners of different sectors and government agencies, this collaborative effort will address critical challenges in OSW transmission and integration, its grid enhancement technologies, and the shortage of domestic workforce, seeking intelligent, cost-effective, and industry needed solutions to enable a smooth transition towards an offshore economy and secure energy future.\r\n\r\nThe mission of GOWIND is to drive innovative and scalable technology development, seek synergism in research, execute domestic workforce training, accelerate standards development, boost regional engagement, promote knowledge sharing, and ultimately support the creation of a resilient and sustainable energy future. GOWIND will address a wide spectrum of key unmet industry needs focused on OSW transmission and integration. The Center\u2019s research thrusts encompass high-voltage direct current transmission and converter technologies, grid congestion management and interoperability, energy storage and Power-to-X, grid-forming inverters, coordinated control and operation, condition monitoring and predictive maintenance, and cyberphysical resilience. These areas represent significant economic and technical challenges in OSW integration into the aging infrastructure. The NJIT site offers multidisciplinary expertise in power systems, renewable energy integration, grid optimization, sensor technologies, and advanced computational techniques. With state-of-the-art facilities and strong support from the Sensor Research Lab, Green Technology Research and Training Lab, Intelligent Power Grid Lab, Power System Dynamics Lab, Control and Optimization Lab, Networked Controls and Intelligent Diagnostics Lab, and Renewable Energy Systems Training Lab, NJIT will drive the development of resilient, efficient, and scalable technologies to support the growing offshore wind industry, in collaboration with Rowan and industry partners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
