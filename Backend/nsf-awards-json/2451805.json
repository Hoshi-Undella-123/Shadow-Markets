 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a novel power-dense, flexible solar panel technology designed to meet the urgent energy demands of rapidly growing sectors such as aerospace, electric vehicles, the Internet of Things (IoT), and buildings. These high-specific-power solar panels leverage advanced transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials, enabling power-per-weight performance up to 10 times higher than current alternatives. The innovation has the potential to unlock transformative applications, from extending the range, lifetime, and capabilities of drones and satellites to powering trillions of smart IoT devices and electrifying vehicles and building surfaces. The immediate target market, including satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles, is estimated at approximately $20 billion, with broader market potential exceeding $140 billion by 2027. The project supports domestic energy independence, job creation, economic growth, and educational advancement in the energy and semiconductor sectors.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in advancing a high-efficiency, scalable solar cell technology based on TMDs such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS\u2082), tungsten disulfide (WS\u2082), and tungsten diselenide (WSe\u2082). These materials possess optimal band gaps, high optical absorption, and environmental durability ideal for thin, flexible photovoltaics. While prior research has demonstrated promising individual performance metrics such as high open-circuit voltages and current densities, these have yet to be integrated into a single scalable design. This project aims to synthesize low-defect TMD films in a scalable manner and incorporate them into an optimal solar cell design that achieves power conversion efficiency and specific power high enough to enable pilot testing with potential customers. Technical challenges such as interface engineering and material incompatibilities will be systematically addressed through multi-pathway risk mitigation. The expected outcomes will establish the foundational design and manufacturing pathways for commercial-scale high-specific-power TMD photovoltaics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
