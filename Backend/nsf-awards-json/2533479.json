 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \u201cTopology of Arrangements with an Eye to Applications\u201d will be held at the University of Pisa, Italy, during September 1-5, 2025. This topic is of interest to a large international research community, spread across mathematical disciplines. This event aims to both disseminate recent research developments, as well as facilitate contact between emergent junior researchers and established senior members of the community. This award will increase the participation of US-based mathematicians, especially graduate students and early-career researchers.\r\n\r\nThe central theme of the conference is the theory of hyperplane arrangements, with a special focus on the topological aspects of the field, the connection between arrangements and Artin groups (which witnessed striking recent developments) and applications (especially topological data analysis). A special feature of this field is its interaction with several areas of mathematics, and this blend of ideas and perspectives continues to drive significant progress in the area. As such, the conference will touch on connections to, for instance, algebraic topology, geometric group theory, algebraic and geometric combinatorics, matroid theory, algebraic geometry, and singularity theory. In addition to invited speakers, this event will include a contributed poster session and ample time for discussion to foster collaboration among participants. Details are available at the website: https://events.dm.unipi.it/e/arrangements2025\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
