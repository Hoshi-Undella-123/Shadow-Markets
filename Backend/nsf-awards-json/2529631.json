 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a portable surgical simulation platform that enables structured training and objective assessment of orthopedic procedures. The project addresses a critical gap in surgical education by providing a reusable, radiation free, and cost-effective alternative to traditional education methods such as cadaver labs and live patient instruction. This simulator recreates common orthopedic trauma scenarios using anatomically accurate models and real surgical tools, allowing residents to develop technical skills in a low-risk and repeatable environment. A built-in three-dimensional tracking system enables precise simulated X-ray imaging, a core component of orthopedic procedures, while also providing automated performance assessments for objective feedback and skill benchmarking. This approach supports measurable learning outcomes and the establishment of national competency standards. The need for such technology is underscored by recent mandates for simulation-based training in residency programs and the growing emphasis on hands-on, data-driven education to improve patient safety and surgical outcomes. This project promotes the advancement of medical education across diverse training environments, particularly benefiting institutions with limited access to cadaveric or operating room-based instruction and ultimately contributes to national health and welfare by strengthening surgical training and preparing future surgeons for safe, effective clinical practice. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a high-fidelity orthopedic simulation platform that integrates anatomically accurate surgical models and real surgical tools with an electromagnetic 3D tracking system. Together, this enables sub-millimeter tracking of surgical tools and anatomical models, provides radiation-free simulation of intraoperative imaging, and captures quantitative metrics such as procedural efficiency, accuracy, tool-to-bone interactions, and decision-making abilities. These data-driven insights enhance learning by providing objective feedback and performance benchmarking against other residents and expert surgeons. Unlike conventional training solutions, which lack objective assessment or real-world tool dynamics, this platform merges physical and digital components to create a scalable and modular training environment with high surgical accuracy. The approach builds on advancements in simulation, image-guided surgical navigation, and real-time tracking systems to produce a product with immediate applicability in residency programs. Its technical innovation and focus on measurable outcomes establish a new benchmark in surgical education, with potential to expand into other image-guided procedural specialties such as neurosurgery, interventional radiology, and general surgery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
