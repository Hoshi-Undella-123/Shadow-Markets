 "awd_abstract_narration": "Powder metallurgy is widely applied in the manufacturing economy, directly impacting economic welfare and national security. This award supports student participation in the International Conference on Powder Metallurgy and Particulate Materials (PowderMet2025) and the co-located Additive Manufacturing with Powder Metallurgy (AMPM2025) conference, to be held 15-18 June 2025, in Phoenix, Arizona. The support provides an opportunity for outstanding student researchers to attend the advanced manufacturing conferences, present their work, learn from leading experts in the field, and interact with students from other institutions, fostering a sense of worldwide community of scientific inquiry. The supported students will present research posters and participate in the conference poster award competition, among other activities. The relationships with conference participants will help the students in determining their specific areas of interest in this broad field and create colleagues for future interactions and potential collaboration. This will not only stimulate learning and training for the students, but also allow them to be exposed to new research concepts in powder metallurgy and additive manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the student participation in PowderMet2025 and AMPM2025 are to (1) expand career-enhancing learning opportunities for a broader knowledge of powder metallurgy and metal additive manufacturing, (2) promote technology transfer and provide a forum to introduce new research and development activities, (3) promote collaborative partnerships between organizations in advanced manufacturing and in emerging technologies to increase workforce development, and (4) develop a workforce aligned with regional economies based on emerging technologies across the Nation. The conference organizers will support up to 35 successful student applicants, who study at US institutions. An emphasis will be placed on students who would otherwise not be able to attend the conference and students presenting their research results at the conference. The organizers will invite applications through conference announcements and other means. The awards will provide support toward registration and accommodation. The availability of this support will encourage the participation of graduate and undergraduate students who otherwise would be unable to afford attending highly specialized advanced manufacturing conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
