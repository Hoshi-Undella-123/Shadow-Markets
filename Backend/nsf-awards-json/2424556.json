 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM) is a national institute whose mission is to catalyze fundamental research in the mathematical sciences. It focuses on the interplay between mathematics and computers, developed through computation and experimentation. ICERM pursues this mission by supporting theoretical advances related to computation, by addressing mathematical problems inspired through computer exploration, and by promoting technology aiding mathematical reasoning. Mathematics influences an ever-widening range of scientific and industrial enterprises - including artificial intelligence, cryptography, data analysis, image processing, and industrial design - and computation is at the heart of this interaction. The institute has a special focus on training the next generation in computational skills, preparing them for a variety of careers. It also hosts public events showing the beauty and impact of mathematical sciences research and computational advances.\r\n \r\nICERM convenes leading scientists from academia and industry, together with students and early-career researchers, in programs that generate new mathematics and accelerate the development of technology arising from these results. The institute pursues its goals through semester-long programs, with support for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students; week-long workshops disseminating the latest research and catalyzing new collaborations; and small-group research activities. Its independent Scientific Advisory Board chooses topics based on proposals from the scientific community; the resulting programs are open to students and researchers from across the country and around the world. ICERM supports data-driven explorations in both pure and applied areas of mathematics through a culture of open exchange of ideas and an environment rich in computational tools. To this end, it provides sophisticated research infrastructure including access to high-performance computing and state-of-the-art software.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
