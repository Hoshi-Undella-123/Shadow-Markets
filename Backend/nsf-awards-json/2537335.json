 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in social psychology has been at the forefront of studying and using technological advancements. From computational and statistical modeling, to fine grained measurement, to new methods for data collection, and to the discovery of bio-psycho-social mechanisms, the field of social psychology is well positioned to integrate and advance research on artificial intelligence and biotechnology and other technologies in ways that accelerate scientific discovery. \r\n\r\nThe conference convenes experts in social psychology to reflect on the impact of Artificial Intelligence, biotechnology, and other emerging technologies for research and education. The conference begins with a series of talks highlighting the influence of recent technological advancements on the field of social psychology. The conference then moves into a larger group discussion, reflecting on the future of psychology research and education. The conference provides a forum for attendees to consider how these technological tools can best be used to inspire new research questions and influence the teaching of social psychological courses. The conference also sparks discussion surrounding the contribution of psychology to understanding human interactions with these technologies. The conference is widely promoted and is accessible to many social psychologists, including early-career scholars. The discussion and results from the conference are shared broadly. The conference creates new knowledge for how new technologies have transformed the way psychologists approach and conduct their science, and situates social psychologists to lead the way in advancing the science of human-technology interactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
