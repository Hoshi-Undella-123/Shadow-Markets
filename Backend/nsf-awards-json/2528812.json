 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract: Understanding quantum materials where electronic, magnetic, and structural properties are strongly intertwined has the potential to transform technologies in computing, energy, and sensing. This project supports a two-day educational workshop focused on using state-of-the-art electron microscopy techniques to study quantum materials. It brings together students, academic experts, and industry professionals to discuss challenges in using electron microscopes for quantum materials, including how to prepare samples and analyze data. It provides hands-on training, expert-led tutorials, and panel discussions, promoting cross-disciplinary learning and mentorship and helping prepare young students for careers in academia and industry. The workshop also encourages accessibility by offering travel scholarships to at least ten young students. By supporting the development of future scientific leaders and fostering knowledge exchange, this project addresses national priorities in Quantum Information Science and Technology.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: The two-day workshop addresses the need for atomically resolved, spectroscopically capable metrology in the study of quantum materials. While significant advancements have been made in optical, scanning probe, and X-ray-based techniques, there remains a metrological gap in simultaneously achieving high spatial and spectral resolution to capture spin, lattice, charge and orbital couplings at the angstrom scale. This research activity focuses on advancing multimodal electron microscopy methods for resolving atomistic correlations that govern emergent behaviors such as superconductivity, quantum coherence, and topological transport. The workshop highlights critical methodological challenges, including sample preparation for cryogenic and operando experiments, hardware limitations in data acquisition, and software bottlenecks in data analysis. Technical sessions address developments in electron energy loss spectroscopy, ultrafast electron diffraction, correlated light-transmission electron microscopy and electron ptychography. The project brings together leading scientists and instrument developers to present current solutions and emerging strategies, with a strong focus on training graduate students in practical data acquisition, interpretation, and machine learning-assisted analysis. This integrated effort supports the broader goal of building a technically proficient and collaborative research community and workforce around quantum materials characterization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
