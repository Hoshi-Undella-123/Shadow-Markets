 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a research and training program that explores the fundamental building blocks of nature and the forces that govern them. It contributes to one of the most ambitious international scientific collaborations of our time: the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Switzerland. By analyzing data from high-energy collisions between protons, this work helps us better understand the origins of mass, the structure of matter, and the possible existence of new particles or forces. The project trains graduate and undergraduate students, engages high school teachers and students in authentic research through the Cosmic Ray Observatory Project, and fosters public engagement by integrating particle physics with creative media arts. This broad set of activities advances scientific knowledge, strengthens the U.S. research workforce, and promotes science literacy in rural areas and among students with limited access to research opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln group plays a central role in physics analysis, detector operations, computing infrastructure, and future upgrades of the CMS experiment. This award supports precision measurements of Higgs boson, top quark, and electroweak processes, as well as searches for phenomena beyond the Standard Model. The group manages a Tier-2 computing center, leads development of a machine learning\u2013based data quality monitoring system, and oversees data certification during Run 3. It also contributes to the construction and integration of the Phase 2 CMS Inner Tracker for the High-Luminosity LHC upgrade. These efforts are aligned with the strategic goals of the U.S. high-energy physics community and are critical for maintaining the scientific capabilities of CMS as it enters a new phase of discovery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
