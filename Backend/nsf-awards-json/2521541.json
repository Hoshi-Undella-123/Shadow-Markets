 "awd_abstract_narration": "Healthy bone growth is essential to attaining adult stature and maintaining good health, including appropriate levels of physical activity, through life. However, bone growth can be compromised by other essential life functions (e.g., immune function), especially among individuals with restricted access to resources (low-resource environments).  Accordingly, the purpose of this doctoral dissertation project is to examine how variation in living conditions impact bone growth and immune function in children. The study uses minimally invasive methods, and the data generated aid the identification of factors that affect bone growth during childhood. Participants are informed of their bone growth and immunological status, and research findings are shared with public health agencies. In addition to training the graduate student researcher, the study provides additional student and public training and educational opportunities.  \r\n\r\nThis project studies energetic trade-offs in children with varying access to resources to better understand how factors related to living conditions and environmental circumstances relate to childhood bone growth. Quantitative ultrasonometry and accelerometry are used to measure bone growth and physical activity, respectively. Data on food is collected using surveys. Child growth is evaluated through height and skinfolds. Dried blood spots, from fingerpicks, are implemented to measure markers of immune function (e.g., immunoglobulin E and C-reactive protein). In measuring biomarkers of immune function, the project advances NSF investment in biotechnology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
