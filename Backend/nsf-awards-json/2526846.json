 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States semiconductor industry is facing a critical shortage of skilled workers, which threatens the nation\u2019s ability to remain competitive in fields ranging from healthcare and defense to energy and communication. This project, the Semiconductor Workforce Advancement Nexus (SWAN), aims to address this urgent challenge by creating a scalable, university-based training model that focuses on technical training in collaboration with industry. Hosted at the University of California San Diego, the SWAN Center will offer students industry-endorsed coursework, mentorship, and career development aligned with real-world semiconductor job opportunities. Through partnerships with industry leaders such as SEMI and engagement with government and academic institutions, the program will help ensure the U.S. has a workforce capable of sustaining innovation, economic security, and national defense.\r\n\r\nThis project will establish a prototype workforce training center at UC San Diego to explore best practices for preparing students for careers in the U.S. semiconductor industry. The SWAN Center will pilot a structured, integrated model combining (1) online technical instruction through SEMI University, (2) hands-on training via NanoFab workshops, (3) biweekly collaborative learning sessions to reinforce technical material, and (4) monthly leadership and communication workshops. The project also includes bimonthly career seminars and two annual networking events to connect students with industry professionals. Outcomes will be measured through surveys, pre/post assessments, job placement tracking, and participant feedback. Data will be synthesized to evaluate the effectiveness of training modalities, mentorship structures, and faculty-industry collaboration. The project aims to serve as a model for expanding semiconductor workforce development across institutions nationwide.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
