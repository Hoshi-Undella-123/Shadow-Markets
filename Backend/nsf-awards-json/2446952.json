 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site: Advancing InterDisciplinary Education Research in STEM (RAIDERS) at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) plans to train 10 undergraduate students each summer for three summers to conduct STEM Education research. The undergraduate participants, who may be STEM majors or students intending to teach STEM subjects, will spend eight weeks on campus, participating in in-depth research experiences, supplemented with a 1-week dissemination experience at a regional conference. The project expects to provide each participant the opportunity to work as part of a research group on a STEM Education Research project, with options to join on projects in biology, chemistry, mathematics, interdisciplinary sciences education or in teacher development or leadership. The intent of the project is to both enhance the workforce readiness of the participants as they prepare for future careers or graduate school and to increase the broader impacts of the research projects on which they will work.\r\n\r\nThis REU project aims to create opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in professional research- and career-related experiences and build networks in STEM education. There are three overarching goals for the REU participants: 1) Research: develop into collaborative researchers with the skills and habits of mind to conduct high-quality interdisciplinary STEM education research; 2) Network: become part of an interdisciplinary STEM Education Research network both within and outside of MTSU; 3) Dissemination: contribute to and disseminate new knowledge related to interdisciplinary STEM education research. To meet these goals the undergraduate researchers are expected to participate collectively in interdisciplinary research projects contributing to two major strands: Strand 1: Evidence-based professional learning experiences for STEM instructors. This strand involves established research projects that support the instructional development and professional learning of STEM graduate students, faculty, and secondary mathematics teachers. Strand 2: Building STEM learning environments that promote student learning encompasses established research projects seeking to advance knowledge and understanding in how students engage with various evidence-based instructional strategies. These evidence-based strategies may incorporate integrated mathematics and science instruction, Peer-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL), Open Educational Resources (OER), and case-based instruction. As undergraduate students, the participants will be the closest to the phenomenon of interest: learning in undergraduate settings. Thus, the contribution to research is predicted to lead to improved STEM education and educator development for the broader STEM education disciplines in which they will work. This project is funded by NSF's Improving Undergraduate STEM Education program, which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
