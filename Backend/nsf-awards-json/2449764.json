 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Facilitating Research at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project will fund research that investigates the fundamental mechanics of bistable structures, which can rapidly switch between stable configurations, and are essential components in both natural and technological systems, such as hummingbird beaks and robotic mechanisms. In recent years, a promising design approach has emerged, utilizing materials that respond to environmental stimuli like light or heat, enabling structures to autonomously adapt to operational conditions. This award will support research into how non-uniform environmental stimuli interact with system design parameters to influence the switching behavior of bistable arch building blocks. Understanding these interactions intend to enable the rational use of non-uniformity to drive design breakthroughs in areas of national technological interest, such as advanced robotics, micro-electromechanical systems, and next-generation materials. Additionally, the project seeks to contribute to the development of a competitive STEM workforce by providing early research experience and mentoring for undergraduate and high school students.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to fill a critical gap in the study of morphing materials and structures by analyzing the effects of non-uniform thermal stimuli on bistable arches. While most studies assume a uniform stimulus or rely solely on numerical methods, this project aims to develop general, fundamental principles that can be applied broadly to active multi-stable structures and devices. The research will utilize nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory to create analytical and semi-analytical models, providing insight into the impact of thermal non-uniformity and identifying how imperfections influence stability. Experimental validation will be performed using photothermally excited bimetal arches, helping to refine the models and improve understanding of system behavior. The knowledge gained looks to pave the way for new design strategies in modular morphing structures and metamaterials, advancing responsive materials systems and driving innovation in cutting-edge applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
