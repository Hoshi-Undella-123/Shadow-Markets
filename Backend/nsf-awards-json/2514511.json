 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ground-based magnetic field observations play a fundamental role in geospace research, especially in understanding severe space weather events that drive geomagnetic-induced currents (GICs) that can impact navigation and satellite communication.  The Magnetometer Array for Cusp and Cleft Studies (MACCS) array provides observations from the high Canadian Arctic, which is playing an increasing role in national security, and the observations are important for aviation and maritime navigation.  Studying the Earth's space environment has become increasingly crucial to our technologically based society.  The MACCS array fills a significant geographical gap at northern high latitudes between arrays in Greenland and Canada.  MACCS data have been used by many space scientists worldwide for event studies and statistical studies and as input into empirical models.  High-latitude geomagnetic observations during rapid changes in the Earth's geomagnetic field are critical, as they impact mission-critical navigation for the US, NATO, and our allies.  MACCS data contributes to creating and validating geomagnetic models such as the World Magnetic Model.\r\n\r\nThis project operates the MACCS network, disseminates its data, and conducts space weather relevant scientific studies.  Scientific analysis of MACCS data is conducted in collaboration with other ground-based and space-based research teams and undergraduate and graduate students to support scientific workforce development.  MACCS has contributed to the study of ULF waves, magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, ionospheric convection, and magnetic storm and substorm processes for three solar cycles.  The location of several MACCS stations under the field of view of the NSF-funded SuperDARN radar network, their proximity to the field of view of the Relocatable Atmospheric Observatory in Resolute Bay, Canada, the nominal \"conjugacy\" of four MACCS stations with U. S. Antarctic stations, and the co-location with dual high-sampling-rate GPS TEC receivers makes possible additional comparative studies and significantly leverages other NSF-supported infrastructure.  Near-real-time digital data and on-demand plots via the MACCS website, as well as via THEMIS GMAG, CDAWEB, and SuperMAG, make it possible for all interested collaborators to freely access the MACCS data set.  During the next five years, the team will focus on maintaining operations and conducting scientific analysis of MACCS data.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
