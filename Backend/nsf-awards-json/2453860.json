 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the Bloomington Geometry Workshop in the years of 2025, 2026, and 2027, with the 2025 meeting taking place at Indiana University on April 4-6, 2025.  It also supports the affiliated Geometry, Groups, and Dynamics (GGD) Day, a smaller-scale regional workshop, to be held on a Saturday each spring.  The workshop will promote interaction and scientific cooperation among mathematicians engaged in cutting-edge research in geometry and related areas. The workshop emphasizes the training and professional development of graduate students and other early-career researchers. Such experiences are critical to the development of early-career mathematicians, new members of a workforce that will help the nation address the technological challenges of the 21st century. \r\n \r\nThe workshop employs a format that strongly encourages both formal and informal interaction among students, postdoctoral associates, and more established mathematicians.  The workshops begins with a Friday afternoon Colloquium by the plenary speaker.  The 2025 plenary speaker will be Laura DeMarco.  The workshop continues on Saturday with five talks, a curated grouping of junior participants with speakers for lunch, a poster session, and a banquet on Saturday.  It concludes with two talks on Sunday.  The GGD Day program includes 4 speakers on a single Saturday, held at a location which rotates among institutions in central Indiana and Illinois, including rural, primarily undergraduate-serving, and urban campuses.  More information about the BGW can be found at https://bgw.sitehost.iu.edu/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
