 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project covers travel expenses for fifteen eligible students from US institutions of higher education to the 21st Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) International Conference on e-Science (eScience 2025). Attendance will help prepare the next generation of scientists and engineers for roles in academia, government, and industry via meaningful exposure to advanced research methods, professional networks, and collaborative environments.  Participation in the conference will bolster students\u2019 career trajectories and national competitiveness in the global research ecosystem. The student travelers get the opportunity to experience the conference professional activities and establish useful connections with mentors in their fields. This award will enable the student travelers to engage directly with leading experts, developers of cutting-edge technologies, and interdisciplinary research communities around data- and compute-intensive research fields such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) for a wide variety of target architectures including High-Performance Computing (HPC), cloud computing, and Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures. \r\n\r\nThis program directly supports the development of a highly skilled U.S.-based and domestic research workforce equipped to advance data- and compute-intensive science. Students selected for travel support gain exposure to cutting-edge interdisciplinary research in areas such as artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and cloud-to-edge systems. They also gain access to professional networks and mentors in emerging fields. Supporting participation in the eScience 2025 conference helps develop a skilled domestic workforce capable of addressing complex scientific and technological challenges of national importance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
