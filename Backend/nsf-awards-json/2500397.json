 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Presidential Memorandum (PM) titled Modernizing United States Spectrum Policy and Establishing a National Spectrum Strategy directed that the National Spectrum Strategy (NSS) include a roadmap to make spectrum resources available to continue U.S. leadership in advanced wireless technologies and services.  It calls for a \u201cpipeline\u201d of spectrum bands to support commercial innovation and agencies\u2019 needs now and into the future.  The NSS identified five spectrum bands for near-term, in-depth study to determine whether the bands may be repurposed for expanded or more efficient uses.  Studies will be conducted by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory for the 7125-8400 MHz band (referred to as the 7/8 GHz band study) and the lower 3 GHz band, including 3.1-3.45 GHz as the primary band for repurposing, to determine astronomy spectrum use and impacts from repurposing.\r\n\r\nNSF\u2019s effort under the National Spectrum Strategy Spectrum Pipeline will include study work in the 3 and 7/8 GHz range to ascertain spectrum use by radio astronomical observatories through automated spectrum monitors combined with observing records, as well as possible impacts from band use modifications for broadband communications through direct studies. As developers and operators of the most sensitive radio astronomy receivers in the US, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) has the necessary skillsets and instrumentation to carry out the required band studies. These studies will inform further efforts, such as spectrum repurposing through auctions, to enable ground-base astronomy to continue work in the affected frequency ranges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
