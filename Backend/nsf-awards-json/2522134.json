 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary international scientific organization in the fields of computational linguistics, natural language processing and human language technologies. The annual meeting of its Nations of the Americas chapter (NAACL) is one of the most prestigious and selective international conferences in these fields. The Student Research Workshop (SRW) is an established tradition at NAACL conferences, allowing students to present their research and receive feedback from more senior researchers. It provides a valuable opportunity for students at different stages of their academic careers. This grant supports student participation at the NAACL-HLT 2025 Student Research Workshop, which will take place during the main NAACL-HLT conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico from April 29 to May 4, 2025.\r\n\r\nStudent participants will submit to present either a thesis proposal to receive feedback or a research paper which describes completed work, or work in progress with preliminary results. Additionally, there will be a pre-submission mentoring program, which enables students submitting to the SRW to first get feedback on their work from a post-PhD expert in their field. Undergraduate and graduate students at the early stages of their graduate career get a chance to present their work and receive feedback before it becomes suitable for publication at the main conference. The SRW also provides valuable experience for the student organizers, who are directly involved in recruiting reviewers, managing the review process and running the workshop.  Overall, the opportunities for interaction with other students and with senior researchers will positively influence the student participants and will likely inspire many to devote further effort to academic studies and careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
