 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of a material for capturing carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) emissions from industrial and power plant sources. Billions of tons of CO\u2082 are emitted globally each year, and there is a need for scalable, cost-effective capture technologies. Current solutions are often energy-intensive, toxic, and/or prohibitively expensive. This technology uses a bio-degradable, non-toxic material derived from renewable feedstocks such as wood and agricultural waste. Commercial applications include the sequestration of exhaust gases and passive CO\u2082 capture from the atmosphere in industries such as energy production, cement and concrete manufacturing, and air purification, with broader applications in filtration and thermal insulation. The material\u2019s lightweight, porous structure enables efficient CO\u2082 adsorption, while its simple manufacturing method allows for shaping into a variety of forms for many applications. This technology may provide a low-cost, environmentally responsible material that is easily produced, regenerated, and, at the end of its lifecycle, recycled, mulched as fertilizer or incorporated into concrete.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of nanocellulose xerogels for carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) capture. The material is produced from renewable feedstocks such as wood and agricultural waste using a combination of freeze\u2013thaw toughening, solvent exchange, and ambient drying to produce monolithic structures with extremely low density and high surface area. In addition, the material is functionalized with amino acids and peptides to enhance CO\u2082 affinity without the need for corrosive or toxic chemicals. This structural and chemical synergy enables reversible CO\u2082 adsorption, efficient regeneration, and a long operational lifespan. Unlike traditional amine-based technologies, this material does not require special reactors, uses no hazardous solvents, and avoids high energy input during manufacturing. Laboratory demonstrations show competitive CO\u2082 uptake (~1 mmol/g), with additional potential in passive capture and closed-environment applications. This material may have applications beyond CO\u2082 capture, including superabsorbents, air and water filtration, oil remediation, and thermal insulation, and can be safely composted or used as fertilizer at the end of its use cycle.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
