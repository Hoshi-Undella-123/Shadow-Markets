 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project supports a workshop addressing the rigor and reproducibility of research conducted in the area of electrocatalysis.  Electrocatalysis research has ramped up significantly in recent years as related to energy-efficient manufacture of fuels and chemicals.  The workshop is led by Dr. Eric Stuve of the University of Washington, with co-organizers Ezra Clark (Pennsylvania State University) and Liney Arnadottir (Oregon State University).  More than 50 experts from the academic community will convene at the University of Washington campus in Seattle on July 8-10, 2025 to determine how research in electrocatalysis can meet the highest standards of scientific inquiry.  The participants will include senior, junior, and student researchers from both large and small research groups.  Workshop outcomes will be widely disseminated within the research community via a report to NSF and an article in a high-impact catalysis journal.\r\n\r\nElectrocatalysis is a broad research area of fundamental importance in developing new technologies in clean energy and electrosynthesis. Two key examples are production of green hydrogen by using renewable electricity for electrolysis of water, and electroreduction of CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels. To support researchers in these critical areas, there is a need for better standards for water oxidation and oxygen evolution, CO2 reduction, hydrogen oxidation, general electrochemical experimental procedures,and analysis of results. The Workshop on Rigor and Reproducibility in Electrocatalysis will examine how research in electrocatalysis can meet the highest standards of scientific inquiry. The primary goals of the Workshop are: 1. Identify, evaluate, and codify practices and expectations for conducting and reporting rigorous and reproducible research in electrocatalysis, 2. Strengthen the caliber of electrocatalysis research through exchange of scientific ideas among researchers, and 3. Foster relationships that promote professional development of current researchers and recruiting of new students to the field. The planned topics of discussion are: (1) electrocatalyst preparation and characterization; (2) electrochemical kinetics; (3) best practices, education, and professional development, (4) spectroscopies and operando analysis; and (5) microkinetics, theory, and benchmarking. The workshop will be conducted over two and one-half days, consisting of four half-day sessions devoted to each topic and a final half-day session to prepare recommendations related to technical challenges and workforce development.  The Workshop promises to make a substantial impact on electrocatalysis research, both in strengthening the findings of current and near-future research efforts and by laying the groundwork for coordinated longer-term research to address the concomitant needs of science and technology. The final report will provide guidelines for experiment design, measurements, and benchmarks, recommendations for comprehensive data analysis, and standards for preparing and reviewing publications. Well-defined concepts in electrocatalysis rigor and reproducibility will also inform preparation of research proposals and their review by funding agencies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
