 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program, this Implementation and Evaluation Track Project at the University of Houston-Downtown (UHD) seeks to empower STEM students through structured computational data science research. The project will establish a structured undergraduate research program designed to equip students with essential skills in computational data science. Through a year- long experience, undergraduate students majoring in mathematics, applied statistics, data science, and computer science at UHD will gain exposure to machine learning, data analysis, and statistical modeling. The program will integrate academic coursework, mentorship, and hands-on research opportunities, contributing to broader participation in STEM \ufb01elds and enhancing career and graduate school readiness.\r\n\r\nThis project will implement a Directed Reading Program (DRP) focused on machine learning and computational data science. A cohort of undergraduate students will engage in specialized coursework, including Special Topics in Machine Learning I & II, followed by a summer research experience. During this phase, students will apply theoretical knowledge to real-world data problems and contribute to ongoing faculty research. Additionally, the program will support the dissemination of research \ufb01ndings through faculty and student presentations at professional meetings, scholarly publications, and student-centered outreach events such as the Student Research Symposium, Open Houses, Data Fest, and Math and Data Science club meetings, as well as on popular media platforms. Students will also participate in developing instructional content and pedagogical tools. Through these activities, the project will strengthen STEM education, increase engagement in computational research, and enhance institutional capacity for high-impact practices in undergraduate STEM education. Funded by the HSI Program, this project aligns with broader e\ufb00orts to enhance undergraduate STEM education, positively impact the STEM workforce, and build institutional capacity for innovative teaching and learning at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
