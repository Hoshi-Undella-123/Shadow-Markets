 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a research program to study the biomechanical origins of bone fragility in aging and type-2 diabetic populations. The most basic building blocks of bone are collagen and mineral. Aging and diabetes change the microstructure of bone through increasing the number of interconnections (crosslinks) of bone\u2019s collagen network. This increase in crosslinks is hypothesized to reduce bone resistance to fracture. The mechanisms that are responsible for the observed increase in bone fragility will be investigated during the project. The findings are likely to have significant implications for public health, particularly as diabetes prevalence rises. The project supports NSF's mission by promoting scientific progress, advancing national health, and potentially leading to targeted therapeutic treatments that could improve quality of life for all Americans.\r\n\r\nThis work will look to reveal the role of advanced glycation end product cross-links on fracture behavior at quasi-static and dynamic loading rates representative of physiological and fall-event strain rates. Fracture experiments will be supported by elasto-plastic fracture theory, anisotropic stiffness tensors derived from non-destructive acoustic elastography, and high resolution in-situ imaging to provide new insights of active crack growth mechanisms. Because this study uses human tibia and fibula specimens obtained from healthy and diabetic individuals, for the first time fracture behavior will be assessed against bone specific quantities of 15 different advanced glycation end product cross-link types. Statistical analysis will aid in pinpointing the specific mechanisms and advanced glycation end products responsible for bone embrittlement and therefore look to support targeted therapeutic treatments to recover bone\u2019s fracture resistance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
