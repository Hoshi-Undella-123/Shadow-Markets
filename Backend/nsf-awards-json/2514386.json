 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Geometry Labs United (GLU) conference, to be held in Madison, WI, in June of 2026.   The conference will bring together approximately 130 members of the 20 labs in the GLU network. The primary aim of the conference is to discuss the research produced by the labs, share expertise in activities developed at the labs, and discuss the creation of new labs with prospective network members. This will be the fourth GLU conference, following GLU 2015 at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, GLU 2017 in University of Washington, and GLU 2020 held online by the George Mason University in collaboration with ICERM. \r\n \r\nThe Geometry Labs United network brings together institutions in the United States, Canada, and Europe that share the vision of vertically-integrated research conducted by undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty, with extensive use of computer-based experimentation and visualization. Research projects at the labs, while often geometric in nature, encompass all fields of mathematics. The research component of the conference will bring together researchers---from undergraduate to faculty---to share their work in experimental mathematics. Expertise in relevant tools (e.g. 3D printing, cloud computing, quantum computing, AI) will be shared through formal talks and informal conversations. The conference website is at https://sites.google.com/view/geometrylabsunited2026/home\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
