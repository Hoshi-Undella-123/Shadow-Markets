 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project develops a novel diagnostic tool for power modules used in electric vehicles (EVs) that can improve their reliability and efficiency. Power modules are critical for the electrification of transportation.  However, their widespread adoption is hindered by module failures, which can lead to expensive repairs and vehicle downtime. Existing diagnostic methods are limited in their ability to detect the interconnected nature of electrical, thermal, and mechanical faults in real time. This project addresses these limitations by introducing a fault detection method that will enable predictive maintenance, reducing failure rates and extending module lifetime. The technology leverages acoustic wave analysis to detect and predict these failures before they occur. This technology will enable proactive maintenance, reduce repair costs, and extend the lifespan of EVs. Additionally, the project may create new job opportunities in the manufacture, installation, and maintenance of the monitoring system. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop a wideband acoustic emission sensing system capable of detecting and diagnosing multiple fault types in power modules, including electrical fault, thermal runaway, and mechanical fatigue. Building on prior foundational research, this project will extend the application of acoustic sensing to power electronics by developing robust sensor systems and data analysis tools for real-time fault monitoring. Advanced signal processing techniques will be employed to identify fault-specific signatures, enabling predictive diagnostics and early fault detection. The research will also include customer discovery activities to refine the technology for practical deployment. By integrating innovative sensing technology with data-driven insights, this project seeks to address a critical challenge in power electronics reliability and support the broader adoption of energy systems. This project will result in advanced power module monitoring, leading to more reliable and efficient electric vehicles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
