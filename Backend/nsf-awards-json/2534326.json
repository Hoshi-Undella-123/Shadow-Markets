 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) program supports a broad spectrum of investigators advancing computational understanding of nervous system structure and function, mechanisms underlying nervous system disorders, and computational strategies used by the nervous system. The goal of this meeting of CRCNS Principal Investigators is to foster interaction and collaboration across this vibrant community, highlighting the intellectual advances and broader impacts of CRCNS awardees. The meeting, scheduled for November 13-14 in La Jolla, California, is hosted by the University of California San Diego and includes poster presentations, talks, and plenary lectures, covering all areas of computational neuroscience represented by funded projects in the program. The meeting will include projects involving the United States, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, and Spain, sponsored by NSF and eight other partner agencies.\r\n\r\nThis international meeting should have a significant impact on the participants and the future of computational neuroscience, including applications to artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and translational research. The meeting results will be publicized to the research community through publications and the meeting website. The broader impacts of the meeting are to facilitate progress in the field and stimulate conversations, connections, and collaborations that will lead toward better informed and effective CRCNS research community and resulting technologies that will be beneficial to all Americans.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
