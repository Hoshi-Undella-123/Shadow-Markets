 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Spectrum and Wireless Innovation enabled by Future Technologies (SWIFT) and Next Era of Wireless and Spectrum (NewSpectrum) programs are multi-year, cross-directorate initiatives of the National Science Foundation (NSF). SWIFT focuses on advancing effective spectrum utilization and coexistence techniques, while NewSpectrum explores novel approaches to using and managing the wireless spectrum beyond the current paradigm of long-term exclusive-use license auctions. The NSF SWIFT/NewSpectrum Principal Investigator (PI) Meeting is an annual event that brings together NSF-funded investigators and researchers to share research findings, discuss challenges and opportunities, engage with NSF staff, and explore future research directions. This project supports the organization of the 2025 PI Meeting, to be held at Virginia Tech\u2019s Innovation Campus in Alexandria, Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the NSF SWIFT/NewSpectrum PI Meeting is to provide a forum for technical exchange and information sharing among NSF-funded researchers and NSF staff. The two-day event will feature a tightly focused program including presentations by NSF staff, a keynote address by an invited speaker, short oral presentations by PIs, poster sessions, panel discussions, breakout sessions, and summary reports. The annual PI meeting provides substantial benefits to the spectrum research community. First, it enables PIs of funded projects to showcase their work, disseminate research findings to NSF staff and peers, receive constructive feedback to enhance project outcomes, and increase the visibility and impact of their research. Second, the meeting offers a valuable forum for PIs to actively engage with NSF staff\u2014initiating dialogue, asking questions, and exchanging perspectives\u2014while gaining insights into evolving programmatic priorities and strategic directions. Third, the event fosters networking among researchers, helping to identify shared interests and explore potential collaborations. Finally, the meeting supports career development by offering access to keynote talks, panel discussions, breakout sessions, and poster presentations, as well as opportunities to connect with fellow PIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
