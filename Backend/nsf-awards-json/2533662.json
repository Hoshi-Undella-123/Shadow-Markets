 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports travel for selected graduate students based in the United States to attend the 41st International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2025), which will take place at the University of Calabria, Italy, on September 12-19, 2025. The conference will feature two major training opportunities: the Doctoral Consortium and the Autumn School in Logic Programming. These events provide students with an immersive environment for exploring advanced topics in AI and logic-based programming. Participation in these activities will help students develop their professional skills, build academic networks, and gain exposure to state-of-the-art research. The project serves the national interest by promoting the progress of science and supporting the development of a skilled workforce in AI to address challenges in modern intelligent systems.\r\n\r\nThe project strengthens education and research in the area of Logic Programming, a foundational discipline within AI that supports reasoning, decision-making, and symbolic knowledge representation. The supported students will attend lectures, seminars, and mentoring sessions designed to deepen their understanding of technical topics and enhance their research effectiveness. Through face-to-face interaction with research experts, students will refine their research ideas, receive constructive feedback, and explore career development pathways. The award will foster a cohesive student cohort that remains engaged beyond the event through continued mentorship and shared academic goals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
