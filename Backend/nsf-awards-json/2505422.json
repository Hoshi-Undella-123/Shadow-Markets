 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semiconductors are foundational to the technologies that power modern life, from artificial intelligence and telecommunications to healthcare and the automotive industry. U.S. leadership in these sectors depends on advancing domestic semiconductor research and manufacturing. While the U.S. pioneered the field, it now produces only about 10% of the global semiconductor supply and relies heavily on Asia, especially Taiwan. Taiwan leads the world in semiconductor manufacturing, supported by top-tier research institutions, leading companies, a robust supply chain, and strong government investment. The International Research Experiences - Pathway for Research and Innovation in Semiconductor Manufacturing (IRES-PRISM) program creates a summer research opportunity for U.S. undergraduate and graduate students to engage in cutting-edge research on semiconductor devices and manufacturing in Taiwan. Over five years, the program will support 40 student researchers from the U.S. to gain hands-on experience, immerse themselves in Taiwan\u2019s vibrant semiconductor ecosystem, and build lasting research partnerships. Working with mentors from both the U.S. and Taiwan, students will be well-positioned to advance U.S. innovation and global leadership in the semiconductor industry.\r\n\r\nBuilt on established partnerships with leading institutions in Taiwan across multiple engineering disciplines, the IRES-PRISM program advances frontier semiconductor research in thermal management, IoT sensors, and data-driven, sustainable manufacturing. Leveraging Taiwan\u2019s global leadership in semiconductor manufacturing, the program positions participants at the forefront of U.S. semiconductor innovation. Students engage in undergraduate co-ops, graduate research, and dual master\u2019s degrees in semiconductors, immersing themselves in a rich, industry-relevant research environment supported by Taiwan\u2019s strong industrial base, advanced facilities, and supply chain. IRES-PRISM also fosters sustained collaboration through faculty exchanges, promoting long-term partnerships and transformative technological advancements. The program offers robust technical and professional skill development through workshops in research, leadership, career development, team building, and global awareness. Participants share their research findings to raise public awareness of advancements in semiconductor research and manufacturing. Leveraging the project team\u2019s ongoing semiconductor workforce development initiatives, IRES-PRISM also generates educational materials to amplify its broader societal and technological impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
