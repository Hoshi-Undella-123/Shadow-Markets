 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a minimally-invasive drug and device combination therapy for potentially malignant oral lesions and early-stage oral cancers. Cancers of the oral cavity are among the most common malignancies worldwide, with more than 377,000 new cases and almost 178,000 deaths in 2020. Clinical management of pre-malignant oral lesions can be particularly challenging due to their uncertain prognosis and lack of any non-surgical option for clearance of lesions that may or may not undergo malignant transformation. The technology builds on the development of a light therapy for treatment of oral lesions. Excellent results have been achieved in an initial clinical study.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a photodynamic therapy that uses a photosensitizing agent combined with red light to selectively trigger lethal photochemistry in target tissue. Compared to surgery or radiation therapy, this technology has minimal side effects and superior healing of the oral mucosa.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
