 "awd_abstract_narration": "This IRES project engages U.S. undergraduate and graduate students in international research experiences focused on digital twin technology in logistics. A digital twin is a real-time virtual replica of a physical system, such as a port or warehouse, that enables better monitoring, prediction, and decision-making. Through immersive research at one of Europe\u2019s largest logistics hubs\u2014the Port of Hamburg in Germany\u2014students will apply this technology to real-world challenges like optimizing urban deliveries, mitigating supply chain disruptions, and improving port operations. The experience is designed not only to develop technical and research skills but also to build cultural awareness, teamwork, and global competence.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the integration of digital twin technology in logistics, targeting U.S. undergraduate and graduate students. In collaboration with the Institute of Information Systems (IWI) at the University of Hamburg, each year a cohort of eight students (4 undergraduate and 4 graduate) will spend six weeks at IWI, working on multidisciplinary projects that address challenges in logistics systems, such as optimizing port traffic, analyzing supply chain disruptions, and enhancing urban deliveries. Students will be grouped into four research teams, each consisting of one undergraduate and one graduate student, supervised by mentors from both the University of Louisville and the University of Hamburg. Each team will work on a unique research project supported by pre-trip preparation, a six-week immersive research experience, and post-trip follow-up activities including publication and career development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
