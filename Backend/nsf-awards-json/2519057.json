 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of a device to assist leg mobility that focuses on the hip. While hip flexor (bending) weaknesses are a common deficit experienced by many populations including those with neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, individuals with hip replacement, and healthy aging populations, few wearable devices exist that assist with hip bending. There is a challenge creating devices that work effectively due to differences in body shape and size. This technology is a form-fitting, soft robotic device called an exosuit that may be used for mechanical assistance and rehabilitation of the hip. The exosuit technology is a lightweight alternative to rigid exoskeletons used to assist mobility that is a clothing-like wearable device for movement assistance. In addition, this technology has been designed to be configurable, which allows the device to be adapted to people of different sizes and shapes. This customization may improve the assistance provided by the device. The goal is to increase the wearer\u2019s mobility and gait quality and improve outcomes for people with mobility challenges.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a robotic device for biomechanical assistance and rehabilitation of the lower extremity. The technology is a wearable, form-fitting, soft exosuit that is focused on the hip and may be configured to match the shape and functional needs of the user. Currently, the availability of hip flexion orthoses is limited due to the difficulty of fitting a device to the hip joint, where the geometry around the midsection is highly variable between individuals. To address this, a system was developed for modeling the interaction of the user and device, where individual surface geometry and functional abilities are incorporated into analyses that enable individualized optimization of device configuration. Simulation results demonstrate that these optimizations result in varied device configurations across individuals, and that for patient populations there is a positive correlation between the results of symmetry-based neuromuscular goals and thermodynamics-based metabolic goals. The aim is to provide physically minimal interventions that can affect meaningful biomechanical changes in people with a broad range of locomotor deficits.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
