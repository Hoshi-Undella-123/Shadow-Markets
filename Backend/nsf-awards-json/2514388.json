 "awd_abstract_narration": "Septins are a large family of proteins with essential functions for the organization and processes in cells. The conference will gather septin researchers from a breadth of disciplines, who do not regularly have the opportunity to interact in other scientific forums, to discuss recent findings and to forge new collaborations for tackling key unknowns and challenges. The conference will foster cohesiveness and long-term continuity by inviting speakers, who are new in this field of research, trainees and early career investigators. Sessions on real-life links and applications of septin research, along with emerging topics, will inspire and motivate attendees to pursue research having Broader Impacts on society that include animal and plant diseases. \r\n\r\nThe program of the FASEB conference entitled \"Septins \u2013 spatial regulators of cell biology\" will feature sessions on problems of septin assembly and function in the morphogenesis of various cell types, and in cellular processes including cell division, cell migration, and intracellular force transduction. Researchers will present and discuss findings from studies that utilize structural, biophysical, genetic, biochemical and pharmacological methods. In addition to daily poster sessions, roundtable panels will facilitate direct interactions with speakers and mentoring discussions on career development. The schedule will also provide opportunities for group activities that will enable networking in a casual and informal setting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
