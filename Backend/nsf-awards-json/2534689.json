 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a dynamic circulation system to improve accuracy and reliability of 3D bioprinting process as well as the functionality of fabricated tissues and organs that could be used for transplants. One major problem in 3D bioprinting is that the suspended living cells in the bioink often sink to the bottom and adhere with each other to form clusters with different shapes and sizes during printing. This leads to uneven cell placement, which lowers the quality and function of the printed tissues. This issue is especially important for creating transplantable organs, testing new medicines, and developing treatments tailored to individual patients. Current methods, such as active stirring or using special materials, can harm cells, require precise bioink preparation, and are difficult to use with multiple cell types. The solution is a new circulation system that helps prevent cells from sinking and clumping together in the bioink. A peristaltic pump is used to move the bioink from the bottom of the container back to the top, and the bioink is kept gently flowing and well mixed while the cells remain viable. This technology has the potential to improve human health, support medical research, and reduce the need for organ donors, contributing to the nation\u2019s well-being and scientific progress.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a dynamic circulation system designed to mitigate cell sedimentation and aggregation in 3D bioprinting. Bioprinting is widely recognized as a promising solution to fabricate functional tissues and organs suitable for transplantation. Homogeneous cell distribution in scaffolds is essential to final functionality of fabricated tissues/organs. However, it is extremely challenging to achieve homogeneous cell distribution, primarily due to cell sedimentation and aggregation during the bioprinting process. The current mitigation approaches using active stirring and functional biocompatible materials have limitations in low cell viability due to mechanical stress, careful bioink formulation required, and difficulty accommodating multiple cell types in the bioink. The technology is a bioink circulation system to significantly mitigate cell sedimentation and aggregation. A peristaltic pump extracts the bioink from the bottom of the bioink reservoir and replenishes it to the top of the reservoir to achieve active circulation. The circulation flow rate is dynamically changing while the total volume of the bioink is decreasing. The technology improves printing reliability and performance of 3D bioprinting in a number of applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, such as personalized medicine, precision medicine, and drug screening.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
