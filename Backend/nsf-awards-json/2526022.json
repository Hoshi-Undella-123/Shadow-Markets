 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for U.S. researchers to attend the Northeastern Analysis Meeting, which will be held November 1-2, 2025, at the University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware. We plan to host six plenary speakers and expect about 75 total participants, roughly 60 of whom will be non-local. The funds will be used to cover some transportation and accommodation expenses for some plenary speakers (in particular, the early career mathematicians), as well as graduate students, postdocs, and people without external funding. Contributed talks in parallel sessions will provide a venue for the early career researchers to share their work, form professional networks, and get feedback.\r\n\r\nThe conference  brings together junior and established researchers in different flavors of analysis. It will foster new collaborations, particularly among experts in adjacent areas of analysis, and feature new developments in the following three areas: 1. Operator algebras is a vibrant area focusing on important subalgebras of bounded operators on Hilbert spaces. Witnessed by the negative resolution of Connes\u2019 embedding problem, there has been a surge of interactions between operator algebras and quantum information theory (mainly surrounding understanding quantum entanglement, quantum channels and nonlocal games). 2. The area of non-commutative (nc) function theory of several complex variables has experienced explosive growth in the past decade. In the one-variable setting, function theory is intimately connected with operator theory. While questions about holomorphic functions of several complex matrices have proven more difficult, recent progress in the area seems promising. This area links to nc probability and nc harmonic analysis. 3. The field of harmonic analysis is a classical branch of analysis that has important applications and connections to a variety of other fields including analysis of PDEs, geometric combinatorics, geometric measure theory, scattering theory, and complex analysis. Extensions to topological locally compact groups require Banach algebra/operator algebra theory to develop a theory of nc harmonic analysis.
