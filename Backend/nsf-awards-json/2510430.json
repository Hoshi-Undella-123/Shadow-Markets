 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of undergraduate students enrolled at HBCUs so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. This Targeted Infusion Project at Virginia State University is designed to enhance undergraduate chemistry education by integrating computational chemistry into foundational courses. This initiative addresses the significant gap between traditional lab-focused instruction and the increasing necessity for computational skills in both scientific research and industry. By incorporating techniques such as molecular modeling, quantum calculations, and data-driven simulations into the existing curriculum, the project supports the broader mission of advancing national health, prosperity, and welfare through scientific progress. To facilitate this transition, the project includes faculty workshops, dedicated computational resources, and structured curriculum updates, ensuring that all chemistry students acquire essential modern analytical skills. Additionally, the project emphasizes open-access sharing of curricular frameworks, assessment tools, and workshop recordings, enabling peer institutions to adopt these innovative approaches and promoting access to advanced training across various academic contexts.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of this research initiative is rooted in its systematic approach to transforming the curriculum and thoroughly evaluating student outcomes. The course learning objectives will be updated to incorporate hands-on computational exercises, and student proficiency will be evaluated using standardized performance metrics. To support faculty development, expert-led training sessions will focus on simulation software and the utilization of high-performance computing clusters. Additionally, student engagement will be enhanced through merit-based research opportunities in molecular design, specifically by conducting binding affinity studies that will contribute to the refinement of computational models. An external evaluator will implement a mixed-methods assessment to measure improvements in both student competence and confidence. To ensure broad applicability, quarterly dissemination workshops and published reports will be provided, allowing other institutions to replicate this educational framework and promote ongoing improvements in computational chemistry education across the country.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
