 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Geophysical Union\u2019s Fall Meeting is the country\u2019s largest gathering of geoscientists.  The conference provides networking and learning opportunities, but has relatively few attendees from primarily undergraduate institutions and community colleges.  This award provides travel support for attendees from institutions that do not have significant resources available to provide travel funding.  \r\n\r\nThe 2025 American Geophysical Union meeting will take place from 15-19 December in New Orleans, LA.  This award will provide a travel stipend for roughly 40 participants attending the conference.  The cohort of participants will be selected to ensure representation from 2- and 4-year colleges that are deemed primarily undergraduate institutions and consist of a mix of early- and mid-career faculty.  In addition to attending the meeting, the participants will participate in pre-meeting cohort building exercises, participate in professional development activities, and review student posters.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
