 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the translation of two-dimensional materials for use in a range of advanced electronics applications including next-generation computing, quantum computing, low-noise electronics, and other electronic devices. By isolating flakes of these two-dimensional materials that are only one to three atoms thick, these materials gain exciting properties that are not found in their bulk forms. The difficulty of fabricating such atomically thin layers has thus far prevented commercial applications, but the new robotic technologies enable the fabrication at these tiny scales. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of autonomous robotic systems to generate two-dimensional materials quickly and consistently, stack these materials into heterostructures, and fabricate these heterostructures into electronic devices using the existing silicon paradigm. This technology shortens the time for two-dimensional heterostructure and device fabrication, enabling rapid experimentation and development of commercial applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
