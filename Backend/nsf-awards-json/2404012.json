 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in its potential to deliver a transformative, radioisotopic-based power solution for critical applications that demand long-lasting, maintenance-free energy in remote or extreme environments. This next-generation Radioisotopic Power Source (RPS) offers up to 20 years of continuous, stable power\u2014dramatically extending the lifespan of devices in defense, space exploration, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Unlike traditional batteries, which require frequent replacements and create substantial waste, this nuclear-powered RPS minimizes environmental impact and significantly lowers operational costs. By harnessing nuclear engineering fundamentals, this project promotes U.S.-based semiconductor development, strengthening domestic manufacturing in a critical, high-tech sector. This innovation enables essential applications like remote monitoring, asset tracking, and deep-space missions by providing reliable, autonomous power in extreme settings. Additionally, the project advances knowledge in sustainable energy storage and conversion, laying the groundwork for resilient, high-efficiency power systems that meet the increasing demands of diverse markets where conventional solutions are insufficient.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses a critical challenge: delivering sustained, high-efficiency power for devices in locations where battery replacement or charging is impractical or impossible. The project aims to develop an innovative Radioisotopic Power Source (RPS) that provides continuous, long-term power for autonomous operation. Key objectives include optimizing advanced semiconductor materials\u2014specifically silicon carbide (SiC) and indium gallium phosphide (InGaP)\u2014to achieve high energy conversion efficiency. Additionally, the project will focus on refining metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to securely store tritium and gradually release its energy, supporting reliable, maintenance-free operation. The project will also construct a modular, stackable RPS architecture that allows for scalable and customizable power configurations to meet various application needs. This RPS technology will enable devices to operate far longer than traditional batteries, reducing maintenance demands and extending functionality in remote or demanding environments. The anticipated result is a high-performance, scalable energy solution with enhanced reliability, durability, and energy density. By advancing isotopic power systems, this project sets the stage for future innovations in sustainable, long-lasting power solutions across multiple technological fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
