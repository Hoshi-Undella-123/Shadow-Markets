 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial impacts of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project lie in advancing laser targeting, range finding, light detection and ranging (LIDAR), free-space optical communication, and active sensing. The development of nitride-based reflectors will provide enhanced durability, efficiency, and optical performance. The global high-power laser market is expanding rapidly, with increasing demand for reliable, long-lasting optical components. This project will contribute to scientific and economic progress by advancing technological knowledge in semiconductor materials, optoelectronics, and photonics. This technology has wide-ranging applications that include improving national security by enhancing military laser systems, increasing the precision of LIDAR-based remote sensing for autonomous vehicles and improving industrial systems. Beyond these technical advancements, this project is expected to generate high-tech jobs in semiconductor manufacturing, laser system design, and research and development. The commercialization of this technology will foster economic growth and reduce energy consumption in laser-based systems. By integrating these advanced reflectors into various industries, this project will support long-term technological progress, strengthening the broader scientific community, and contributing to innovation-driven economic development.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on developing highly reflective nitride-based Distributed Bragg Reflectors (DBRs) for infrared applications. Current oxide-based reflectors suffer from limited efficiency, laser damage susceptibility, and broad reflection bands, which hinder performance in high-power laser applications. To overcome these challenges, this project will utilize nitride single crystals with varying compositions to achieve more than 99.5% narrow band reflectivity at 1030-1070 nm enabling high-power laser resistance. By fine-tuning layer thickness and composition, we aim to achieve superior optical performance while minimizing point and extended defects formation. Advanced metal-organic chemical vapor deposition techniques will be employed, optimizing growth parameters such as temperature and metal organic flow rates along with the use of nitride native substrates to control film quality. Substrate removal and wafer bonding techniques will be explored to integrate nitride DBRs with silicon and other materials, ensuring compatibility and stability. The project will develop high-performance, crack-free nitride reflectors consisting of AlInN/GaN multilayers, achieving 99.5% reflection and a 40 nm stopband at ~1050 nm. These advancements will enable practical deployment in high-intensity IR environments, supporting next-generation laser technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
