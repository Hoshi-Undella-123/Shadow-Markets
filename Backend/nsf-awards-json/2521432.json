 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mineral dust aerosols are small particles commonly suspended in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere with important implications for weather and climate, ecosystems, human health and visibility, and optical communication and remote sensing systems. Unfortunately, very little is known about the optical properties of mineral dust and how they relate to dust sources and properties. This understanding is necessary to comprehend the roles and impacts of mineral dust aerosols on human and natural systems. This project aims to build capacity toward use-inspired research by gaining such understanding through integrated experimental and theoretical investigations of mineral dust optical properties. This will be of the essence for quantifying mineral dust on global and regional scales, mineral dust effects on weather and climate, and their impacts on human and natural systems. The project will build a three-state collaborative team to develop and demonstrate capacity for use-inspired research by advancing knowledge on the optical properties of mineral dust aerosols in the atmosphere. Use-inspired applications include improving optical remote and in situ sensing of mineral dust aerosols. Additional applications include quantifying mineral dust impacts on human and machine visibility for safe operation of cars and airplanes and on national defense (e.g., optical range finders and target designators) and effects of inhaled mineral dust on human health (e.g., respiratory and pulmonary disease and mortality).  \r\n\r\nMineral dust aerosols dominate aerosol mass and aerosol optical depth in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere with important implications for radiative forcing and climate, fertilization of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, human health and visibility, and optical communication and remote sensing systems. Unfortunately, very little is known about mineral dust optical properties and how they relate to dust sources and dust physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties as needed to understand the roles and impacts of mineral dust aerosols in the earth system. Project outcomes have potential to build capacity toward use-inspired research by gaining such understanding through integrated experimental and theoretical investigations of mineral dust optical properties. This will be of the essence for quantifying the global and regional mineral dust cycles, mineral dust direct radiative forcing, and their impacts on human and natural systems with optical remote and in situ measurements, thereby addressing key national critical and emerging technologies. This project aims to build on research excellence and stakeholders in three EPSCoR jurisdictions (Nevada, Oklahoma, and Wyoming) with the following jurisdictions/partner institutions involved: Nevada (NV): Desert Research Institute (DRI: Overall and NV Lead Institution) and Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC: NV Sub-Awardee); Oklahoma (OK): University of Oklahoma (OU: OK Lead Institution); Wyoming (WY): University of Wyoming (UW: WY Lead Institution) and Central Wyoming College (CWC: WY Sub-Awardee). The project combines a breadth of strengths of the three collaborating jurisdictions, including 1) experimental aerosol optics experience, instruments, and facilities at DRI; 2) availability of the unique and well-characterized DRI global mineral dust collection, 3) leading theoretical light-scattering computational capabilities and expertise at UW, 4) capabilities in applied mathematics at TMCC, and 5) leading strengths in aerosol remote sensing at OU. This project is supported by the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: Focused EPSCoR Collaborations Program (FEC), which supports interjurisdictional teams of EPSCoR investigators to perform research in topics that align with NSF priorities, with the goals of driving discovery and building sustainable STEM capacity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
