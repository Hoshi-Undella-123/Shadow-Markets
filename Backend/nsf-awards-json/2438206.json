 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to build a stronger research system in Arkansas. The goal is to connect different science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields to create better educational paths, support partnerships between universities and industry, and promote research that addresses real-world needs. This effort will create hubs for innovation and increase workforce training in STEM fields. The project will be led by Arkansas\u2019 educational institutions and guided by a Jurisdictional Steering Committee. It will include community colleges, universities, and industry partners. The project\u2019s main goals are to strengthen collaboration between universities and industry, increase participation in STEM, and support long-term research and economic development in Arkansas.\r\n\r\nThis project, known as the Arkansas Nexus for Excellence in Technology, Workforce, Outreach, and Research Knowledge (AR-NETWORK), aims to create a statewide research system that has input from a network of 15 higher education institutions, state agencies, and industry partners across Arkansas. The project\u2019s focus is on connecting research with real-world industry needs to promote innovation and economic growth. AR-NETWORK is organized into three main areas: administration, economic development through research, and workforce development. These areas will work together to create partnerships and align educational paths with industry needs. Key activities include setting up innovation hubs, hosting workshops to identify industry needs, and offering research experiences in local communities to increase access to STEM fields. The project will also improve research infrastructure, support faculty and staff development, and strengthen the Center for Community Engagement and Academic Outreach. By fostering collaboration and enhancing research capacity, AR-NETWORK aims to support innovation and national competitiveness in STEM fields. This project is supported by the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: EPSCoR Collaborations for Optimizing Research Ecosystems (E-CORE). E-CORE supports the strengthening of jurisdiction-wide research ecosystems by fostering interconnected networks and building research infrastructure to grow research capacity and competitiveness aligned with jurisdictional priorities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
