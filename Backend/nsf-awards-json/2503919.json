 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Indian Pacific Warm Pool located in the tropics is the heat engine of the globe. Previous work has proposed that past episodic freshwater fluxes known as Heinrich Events in the Northern Hemisphere abruptly modulate tropical hydroclimate in regions like the Indian Pacific Warm Pool. In this project, cave deposits from the Philippines are used to reconstruct past hydrologic change and investigate the hydrologic response over the Indian Pacific Warm Pool to Heinrich Events. The Philippines is ideally located for this work as it is situated within the Indian Pacific Warm Pool and is sensitive to seasonal variations in rainfall associated with the Asian monsoon systems. This work will accomplish three primary tasks: first, it will expand current cave monitoring efforts in the Philippines to encompass a multi-year, multi-cave monitoring network to better constrain seasonal variations in karst hydrology. Second, it will contribute new high temporal resolution cave geochemistry records spanning numerous Heinrich Events. Third, geochemical data-model comparisons will be conducted to evaluate the mechanisms driving geochemical variability in these records during Heinrich Events.\r\n\r\nResults from this work will help develop a foundational understanding of rainfall pattern changes during abrupt hydrologic variability. By combining multi-year surface and subsurface karst monitoring with new cave records, the influence of Northern Hemisphere freshwater fluxes on tropical hydroclimate will be assessed. The project will also fill in spatial gaps in the western tropical Pacific and improve model accuracy. This work will fortify connections with National Parks/Protected Landscapes, UNESCO World Heritage staff, and cavers. The team's findings will be incorporated in pamphlets/audio guides and guided tours for millions of domestic and international park visitors. Finally, the project includes training of multiple undergraduate students in the geosciences at Occidental College and a graduate student from Brown University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
