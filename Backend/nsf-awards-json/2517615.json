 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Convective Storms (CIRCS) is an industry-university cooperative research center (IUCRC), focused on addressing the needs of the insurance and reinsurance industry that is being impacted by the increasing frequency and cost of convective storms which spin off tornados, damaging hail, high velocity wind gusts (derechos), and extreme rain events which damage property and endanger lives. This is a two-Site Center consisting of faculty from a variety of disciplines from Northern Illinois University and the University of Wisconsin at Madison. These cross-Site, interdisciplinary science teams work closely with members of a sector of the economy, in this case the insurance/reinsurance sector, to identify critical research thrusts that align with sector needs. Faculty teams then propose cutting-edge projects in these areas that respond to input from the Center's industrial advisory board, which is formed by representatives from companies and other interested parties that pay memberships to serve on the Center's Board. Members of the Board work, as a collective, to identify and use the pooled Center membership fees to fund faculty-proposed projects that align with the sector's high priority needs. CIRCS research is organized around six core thrust areas: Prediction, Modeling, Data Science, Climate Variability, Risk, and Societal Impacts. These reflect the multifaceted nature of convective storm hazards and the need for integrated research that spans basic science, emerging technologies, and decision-making applications. Broader impacts of the work include improving the ability of the insurance sector to assess present and future risks and financial consequences of convective storms so they can weather the rapidly changing extreme weather landscape, as well as the training of students involved in Center projects which provides a skilled and workplace-ready workforce able to integrate into jobs in the private sector.\r\n\r\nThe Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Convective Storms (CIRCS) initiates projects that employ a wide array of cutting-edge modeling, mathematical, and data analysis methods including high-resolution numerical weather prediction, ensemble-based forecasting, remote sensing, machine learning, climatological synthesis, and impact-based modeling. Projects are conceived to address and align with high-priority interests of the insurance and reinsurance sector of the economy. Input from industry is obtained through a variety of meetings to discuss sector challenges and needs that reflect the overall sector, as opposed to those of a single company. New projects are proposed on an annual basis by Center-related faculty. Projects are then evaluated by the Center industrial advisory board which, as a group, recommends for funding projects reflecting the highest need of the collective. Through this interdisciplinary and use-inspired science approach, the Center addresses knowledge gaps in convective storm behavior and risk; accelerates innovation in weather-related technologies and analytics; and trains, through involvement of students and postdocs in the projects, the next generation of scientists and practitioners equipped to address the high-impact weather challenges of industry. Projects coming out of the Center include improving short- and long-term forecasts of hail, tornadoes, and damaging winds; understanding how convective storm characteristics shift in a warming climate; developing AI-based tools for rapid risk assessment; and enhancing communication strategies for high-stakes decision environments. Each project is developed through iterative engagement with industry members, ensuring alignment with stakeholder priorities and pathways for technology transition.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
