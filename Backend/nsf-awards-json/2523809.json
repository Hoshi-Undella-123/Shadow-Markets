 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for the 2025 \u201cCyber Physical Systems (CPS) Rising Stars\u201d workshop, held in conjunction with the 2025 Annual CPS Principal Investigators\u2019 Meeting at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, March 2025.  This workshop seeks to mentor promising PhD students and recent PhD graduates interested in pursuing academic careers in cyber-physical systems and help build that next-generation of outstanding researchers.  Cyber-physical systems are engineered systems that deeply integrate computational elements with physical processes and are increasingly essential to the advanced technologies in scientific research and society.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is modeled on prior successful CPS Rising Star workshops. It offers mentoring by leading experts in cyber-physical systems on navigating the early stages of a career in CPS, discussions about the CPS academic job market, guidance on applying for research grants, building research groups and collaborations, and extensive opportunities to network with the broad NSF CPS research communities at both the CPS Rising Stars workshop and the CPS PI Meeting.  Based on applications to the workshop, participants are selected by the workshop program committee of CPS researchers and are provided support for the workshop.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
