 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Conference on Topological Data Analysis: Recent Developments and Applications, University of Missouri-Columbia, November 22-24, 2025, will bring together leading researchers from academia and industry as well as graduate students to discuss and explore the latest theoretical developments and applications of Topological Data Analysis (TDA). TDA has emerged as a powerful framework for capturing the intrinsic shape of data and now informs work in areas such as biology, machine learning, and materials science. Because the field is evolving rapidly across theory, algorithms, and real-world use cases, the program aims to balance cutting-edge theory with demonstrations of practical impact across disciplines. A central goal is to train the next generation of TDA researchers by featuring lectures and presentations from internationally recognized experts, as well as offering oral and poster presentation opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers\u2014an arrangement that accelerates knowledge transfer, broadens participation, and provides early-career mathematicians and scientists with valuable professional experience and networking opportunities.\r\n \r\nThe three-day agenda features keynote and invited talks, short parallel oral sessions, and poster presentations around various themes of TDA such as (1) multiparameter persistence; (2) Mobius inversion techniques in TDA; (3) spectral methods in TDA; and (4) applications across disciplines. By gathering leading theorists with practitioners who apply these ideas to real data, the conference will both advance fundamental understanding of topological data analysis and accelerate its practical use across disciplines, ensuring that mathematical insight continues to fuel innovation. Further details, including the program and speaker information, will be available on the conference webpage at: https://zhengchaow.github.io/tda-conference-2025/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
