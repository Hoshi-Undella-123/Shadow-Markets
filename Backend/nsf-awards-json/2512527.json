 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant resubmission process represents a valuable, often underutilized opportunity for institutions to strengthen proposals and improve funding success rates. Despite its importance, many institutions \u2014 particularly Emerging Research Institutions (ERIs) and Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) \u2014 face persistent challenges in navigating reviewer feedback, identifying areas for improvement, and managing resubmissions strategically. Enhancing institutional capacity for effective resubmissions is critical not only for individual success but also for promoting the progress of science, and advancing national priorities in research and innovation. In parallel, strengthening the capacity for effective technology transfer at these institutions is essential for ensuring that research discoveries can move beyond the lab to benefit society. Identifying a solution for managing the resubmission process \u2014 and supporting innovation pathways through technology transfer \u2014 has the potential to reduce barriers, increase success rates, and build institutional competitiveness nationwide.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis planning grant will support activities to better understand the resubmission process and identify effective strategies for strengthening proposal resubmissions for all institutions, with particular attention to the unique circumstances of ERIs and PUIs. Specifically, the project aims to lay the groundwork for developing a solution to resubmission challenges by: (1) Gathering nuanced insights on resubmission challenges and support needs of the broader research community; (2) Conceptualizing solutions, architectures, and approaches for analyzing reviewer feedback and facilitating resubmission project management; (3) Defining system requirements and developing a comprehensive plan for future development; and (4) Investigating sustainable models for technology transfer at ERIs and PUIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
