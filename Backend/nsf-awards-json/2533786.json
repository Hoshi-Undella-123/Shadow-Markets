 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART 1:   NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY \r\n\r\nThe 2025 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Nanoporous Materials and Their Applications: Innovative Applications and Breakthrough Technologies for Nanoporous Materials, and the associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will be held at Proctor Academy (Andover, New Hampshire) from August 3-8, 2025, and August 2-3, 2025, respectively. Porous materials, such as zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, covalent-organic frameworks, porous carbon, and related materials, are heavily utilized in today's most dynamic and diversified research fields. The program addresses important new findings related to the invention of novel materials, characterization of their unique properties, and the use of these materials in emerging applications involving catalysis, separations, gas storage, and other processes of commercial and environmental importance. Invited lectures, poster presentations, and general discussions focused on linking fundamental understanding to potential applications are core concepts of the Gordon Research Conference format. Beyond the technological aspects, the conference seeks to gather leading and emerging scientists in this field and bring them together to share ideas and foster new collaborations. This support from NSF's Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research enables the participation by U.S. graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, and early-career researchers at the Gordon Research Conference and the Gordon Research Seminar through stipends for registration fees and/or travel support.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe Nanoporous Materials and Their Applications Gordon Research Conference and Seminar focus on new developments in the field of nanoporous materials. For the 2025 iteration of the conference, emphasis is placed on intermingling different classes of nanoporous materials. The program balances theoretical and experimental approaches to addressing questions related to structure, properties and application with sessions on topics including \u201cEngineering of Materials Assemply\u201d, \u201cFundamentals of Structurs and Function\u201d, \u201cAdvances in Synthesis and Characterization\u201d, \u201cParadigms of Multifunctional Materials\u201d, \u201cEmerging Applications of Nanoporous Materials\u201d, and more. With respect to this larger goal, the Gordon Research Conference seeks to provide a common language for all participants; to raise the comfort-level of student and postdoc participants; and, through these efforts, to develop a tightly-woven community held together by a common interest in nanoporous materials. This is facilitated by cutting-edge research presentations as well as opportunities for informal gatherings, and mentoring panels, and in general by providing a venue for scientists from different disciplines to brainstorm together and promotes cross-disciplinary collaborations in the various research areas represented.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
