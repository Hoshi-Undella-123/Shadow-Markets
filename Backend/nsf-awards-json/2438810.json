 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pennsylvania State University\u2019s College of Information Sciences and Technology proposes a cybersecurity education and training initiative that serves a critical national need, preparing the next generation of skilled cybersecurity professionals to protect the United States against digital threats. As cyberattacks grow more frequent and complex, both public and private sectors face an urgent shortage of qualified cybersecurity personnel. This project will recruit and support a diverse cohort of undergraduate and graduate students to receive specialized training in cybersecurity, with a particular emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI)-infused skills. Through scholarships, mentoring, and hands-on learning, the program equips students with cutting-edge technical knowledge and professional development opportunities to ensure they are ready for careers in government service. By placing 100% of its graduates into cybersecurity roles, the initiative directly contributes to national security, supports economic stability, and promotes the progress of science and technology. It also aligns with NSF\u2019s mission by advancing education, increasing participation in the cyber workforce, and strengthening the nation's capacity to respond to emerging cyber threats.\r\n\r\nThe College of Information Sciences and Technology at The Pennsylvania State University, designated as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD) since 2003, proposes a focused cybersecurity education program aimed at recruiting, training, and placing at least nine students (seven undergraduates and two graduate students) into cybersecurity roles with federal, state, local or tribal governments. This project emphasizes the integration of AI into the cybersecurity curriculum, thereby advancing a key area of strategic importance in both national defense and cybersecurity research. The program includes full scholarships of two years, structured mentoring, and career development activities to ensure successful placement of all participants into qualifying government positions upon graduation. The curriculum will incorporate hands-on learning, interdisciplinary research opportunities, and targeted skill development in cyber-relevant fields. Participating students will also take at least four AI courses to obtain AI-infused cybersecurity skills.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program in the Division of Graduate Education, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
