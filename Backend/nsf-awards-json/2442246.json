 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum information processing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computation, communication, and sensing tasks with unprecedented capabilities beyond any classical devices. Investing in quantum information research is crucial for the US economic and national security. Trapped ions are one of the leading platforms of quantum information processors. This CAREER award project will investigate a new technique, called phonon modulation, for improving the performance of trapped-ion quantum information processors. Development in this research will advance the progress of quantum information science and technology. This CAREER award project will also establish an quantum education program accessible to all STEM majors in my institution for developing quantum workforces and organize an outreach program to local high-school students for raising quantum awareness.\r\n\r\nTrapped ions are one of the pristine platforms for quantum information processing. Most of the applications rely on the ability to generate controllable interactions between the internal qubits (spins) of the ions mediated by the external collective motion (phonon modes), often using lasers or microwave currents that generate magnetic field gradients. However, it is a key challenge in this field to enhance the interactions as much as possible without compromising the qubits. In the research part of the CAREER award project, the Principal Investigator (PI) will study modulation of the phonon modes in trapped ions as a new tool for enhancing the effective spin-spin interactions through the explorations of 1) novel protocols with parametric amplification, 2) numerical and analytical approaches for spin-motion interactions with phonon modulation, and 3) hybrid protocols of phonon modulation with pulse shaping techniques. In the education part, the PI will 1) advance in-depth education in quantum information science via course transformations and inclusive community building, 2) teach STEM students a first quantum information science course integrating innovation & entrepreneurship, and 3) organize a Quantum Summer Camp for local high-school students. The results of this CAREER award project will advance the field of trapped ions and related quantum technologies, build capacity and expand the talent pool of quantum workforce, and benefit broader communities beyond the PI\u2019s institution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
