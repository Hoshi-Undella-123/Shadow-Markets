 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) EPSCoR Graduate Fellowship Program (EGFP) supports EGFP designated institutions and programs in EPSCoR jurisdictions by providing funding for graduate fellowships for new or continuing EGFP-eligible applicants. EGFP supports a total of three years of stipend and associated cost-of-education (COE) allowance for each NSF EPSCoR Graduate Fellow. This award at Idaho State University (ISU) will support six EPSCoR Graduate Fellows with funding from NSF EGFP. This support is aligned with goals and programs within the NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), NSF Directorate for Geosciences (GEO), and the NSF Office of Integrative Activities (OIA). This project, Idaho Student Excellence in Education and Research (I-SEER), will advance talent recruitment, development, and retention of researchers in Idaho and thus expand regional excellence in STEM research, strengthening ISU\u2019s research capacity and competitiveness. Integration between Fellows in the Department of Biological Sciences, Department of Geosciences, and Idaho's EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement I-CREWS project will promote interdisciplinary research and build connections among members of participating departments. This will position the University to be a hub that advances scientific knowledge and addresses real-world issues. \r\n\r\nFellows will pursue graduate degrees within the Biological Sciences and Geosciences departments or in the interdisciplinary programs aligned with I-CREWS, including Civil and Environmental Engineering, Computer Science, and Anthropology. The overarching goal is to develop a new generation of researchers equipped to solve pressing scientific and social challenges. Fellows will engage in cutting-edge research using methodologies such as artificial intelligence/machine learning, geospatial analysis, field-based data collection, laboratory investigations, and exploring societal topics in Idaho communities. The project will train six EGFP Fellows to answer cutting-edge research questions. All projects will address complex, critical research problems and train new scientists and engineers to be future leaders. Synergies among participants will occur through cross-cutting workshops for professional development. This project will enhance ISU\u2019s ability to recruit and train talented graduate students and expand regional capacity for STEM research and workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
