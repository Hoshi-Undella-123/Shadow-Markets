 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for US participants, especially graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, to attend the thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth international conferences in Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC), held at Hokkaido University, Sapporo (Japan) from July 21-25, 2025 and the University of Washington, Seattle (USA) from July 13-17, 2026. The most important annual conference series in algebraic combinatorics in the world, FPSAC offers junior American researchers a unique opportunity to interact closely with top mathematicians from many countries. Each conference, which includes nine one-hour plenary lectures, thirty half-hour contributed talks, and sixty posters, will attract over 200 participants from all over the world.\r\n\r\nA distinguishing characteristic of FPSAC conferences is the concerted effort to recognize and encourage outstanding junior scientists. At least one plenary speaker is an \"emerging star,\" and talented junior researchers are well represented among the speakers selected for contributed talks. Attendance at this conference will be exceptionally valuable for graduate students and junior researchers. Somewhat interdisciplinary, the conferences link research in combinatorics to other topics in pure mathematics such as algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, representation theory, K-theory and symplectic geometry, and to topics in other sciences such as computer science, physics, and biology. More information can be found at https://www.math.sci.hokudai.ac.jp/sympo/fpsac2025/ and https://fpsac.org/confs/fpsac-2026/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
