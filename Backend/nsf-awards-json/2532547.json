 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gordon Research Conferences organization has a long history of providing a forum for the presentation and discussion of cutting-edge research in a variety of science and engineering fields, including in coastal ocean dynamics. This grant will provide a partial contribution toward attendee costs for the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) and Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Coastal Ocean Dynamics to be held at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire, from June 7\u20138 and 8\u201313, 2025, respectively. This GRC, convened every two years, brings together academic and federal researchers to share the latest advances and identify new challenges in coastal physical oceanography and related dynamics. NSF has a long track record of supporting attendee participation in this GRC and the funds will be used to support the attendance of US based students, postdocs, other early career researchers, invited speakers and discussion leaders, and other mid-career and senior researchers serving as mentors. This GRC and GRS support scientific advancement and workforce development that support societal well-being. Coastal oceans play important roles in the Earth system, for example by transforming freshwater discharges from land and by dissipating tidal energy. Understanding physical oceanographic and related processes occurring in coastal oceans is necessary to link ocean observations, models, and predictions to societal needs. By fostering collaboration among experts and mentoring of early-career scientists, the conference drives innovations in ocean modeling, observation, and prediction, improving our understanding of coastal systems, contributing to disaster preparedness and resource management, and benefiting coastal communities. \r\n\r\nThe GRC chairs and vice-chairs, elected by attendees at previous GRCs, have designed the programs for the 2025 GRC and GRS on Coastal Ocean Dynamics to facilitate intellectual exchanges between researchers working in complementary areas of coastal physical oceanography and lead to new collaborations. The GRC plenary talks, given by invited speakers selected by the Program Committee, will cover topics including coastal ocean prediction, novel observing techniques, and machine learning. Scheduled session topics are: Coastal Extremes, Low-Latitude Regions, Ocean \u2013 Coastal Seas Interactions, Mid-Latitude Regions, Physical-Biogeochemical Processes, High-Latitude Regions, Observing and Predicting Multi-scale Dynamics in the Ocean, The Global Coastal Ocean, and Techniques and Technologies for Coastal Oceans. The poster sessions are open to presentations on any coastal physical oceanographic or related topic. Discussion Leaders have been recruited to stimulate and moderate discussion after each session. As session chairs, the Discussion Leaders work in advance with the speakers to ensure presentations address new, thought-provoking material and minimize review of existing work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
