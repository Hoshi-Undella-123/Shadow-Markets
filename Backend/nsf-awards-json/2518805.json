 "awd_abstract_narration": "The doctoral dissertation project explores how healthcare providers and patients are navigating biotechnological advances and economic changes within the fertility healthcare industry. In addition to training a graduate student in anthropological science, broader impacts could lead to a better understanding of how lower cost IVF may be expanded. Data and findings will be widely disseminated to improve the public's understanding of IVF biotechnological innovation. \r\n\r\nThe researcher asks what variables drive the promotion and adoption of new fertility technologies. The researcher will conduct interviews with physicians, embryologists, nurses, genetic counselors, and patients across three separate clinical sites, extended behavioral/participant observation within these settings, and a content analysis of materials produced across the clinical settings. The project makes clear contributions to scientific work on dimensions of assisted reproductive technologies, and their access, use, and transformation. The data gathered from the project could also lead to a better understanding of how lower cost IVF may be expanded, in line with the February 18, 2025, Executive Order, \"Expanding Access to In Vitro Fertilization.\"\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
