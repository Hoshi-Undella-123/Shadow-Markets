 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PreK-12 pathways research-practice partnership (RPP) project aims to establish K-12 computational thinking, computer science, and computing \u2013 or \u201cCOMP3\u201d \u2013 pathways in central Texas. The partnership is composed of the national non-profit, Transcend, SRI International, practitioners from Harmony Science Academy Austin and San Marcos Consolidated Independent School District, and representatives from local community nonprofit organizations involved in economic and workforce development, higher education related to COMP3 disciplines, and area technology companies. The goal is for all students to learn COMP3 skills within the core curriculum (math, science, and technology classes) along a progression from elementary through high school. The project builds on Transcend\u2019s groundwork in creating learning environments that use community-based engagement to meet the needs of students, families, schools, and the community. \r\n \r\nThe education approach of this Pathways strand RPP incorporates three foci: (1) 21st Century Learning that provides opportunity for every student and is responsive to the demands and opportunities of the 21st century; (2) the COMP3 graduate aims framework, which defines Intellectual Prowess, Wayfinding, and Well-Being learning outcomes to reflect quality learning and global trends; and (3) a community-based engagement model that uses direct partnerships with communities to transform schooling, support local design, and encourage innovation. The project objectives are to form and expand the RPP, involve community stakeholders in guiding RPP activities, develop a comprehensive understanding of COMP3 preliminary results as a basis of future research and enhancement, develop plans to engage additional schools and districts, and formulate plans to make the model scalable. The RPP will answer preliminary research questions and formulate new questions related to the effectiveness of the COMP3 design and implementation processes, assessment of outcomes, variance between schools, how conditions predict variation in design and implementation, how the community engagement used by schools impacts the conditions, and the effectiveness of teacher training.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
