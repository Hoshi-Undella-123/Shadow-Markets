 "awd_abstract_narration": "Industries of the Future (IotF) is comprised of artificial intelligence (AI), quantum information science (QIS), advanced manufacturing, advanced communications, and biotechnology.  This three-year RET Site will focus on research experiences in biotechnology, AI and machine learning (ML), Internet of Things and communication, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing. The goal of this project is to provide a six-week summer research experience for nine high school STEM teachers to engage in IotF research each year. These project experiences will help teachers develop and implement innovative course modules by translating cutting-edge research in IotF into their high school\u2019s course curriculum using hands on teaching methodologies. The lessons will also meet the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) standards. Additional professional development activities, including industry field trips, will allow teachers to connect academic research with real-world engineering and technology for their students.\r\n\r\nAcademic-year follow-up includes workshops and module discussion and feedback. Through partnerships with schools in the Houston metropolitan area, the project will assist teachers with positively influencing the learning and career paths in STEM of their high school students. The course modules will be disseminated through TeachEngineering.org. The RET project will be shared with middle and high school students in summer camps organized by the project team in collaboration with partners including local ISDs and the UTeach Association. IotF research areas provide growing opportunities for creating the next generation of the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
