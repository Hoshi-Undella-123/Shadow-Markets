 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of undergraduate students enrolled at HBCUs so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of this project is to enhance students\u2019 capacity to engage in biological research through the utilization of genetic engineering and computational biology tools, reduce the attrition rate of students enrolled in the Department of Biological Sciences, and improve faculty mentors\u2019 teaching and research performance through Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) at Fayetteville State University. \r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, the project aims to:  1) improve the ability of student participants to systematically conduct biological research by using scientific methods to develop research questions, define problems, formulate and test hypotheses, gather data through experiments, and draw conclusions, 2) equip participants with the skills to use cutting-edge, innovative genetic engineering and computational biology tools to conduct biological research, 3) achieve persistence in all the six factors of Persistence in the Sciences (PITS) survey among student participants in this project, and 4) enhance faculty teaching and research outputs through productive engagement with students. This project will strengthen biological education at Fayetteville State University by enhancing the quality of education available for students. The proposed initiative will modernize at least four courses and capstone research courses to incorporate inquiry-based research projects to better prepare students for careers in biology and research, with specific targets in genetic engineering and computational biology. Additionally, the project will support a summer camp for high school students\u2019 early exposure to research. The expected outcome of this project will generate new pedagogical knowledge on hands-on training and innovative learning practices that result in students\u2019 building practical skills, capacity in research, and academic momentum, while supporting pathways to graduate study and careers in biological sciences. The project has the potential to serve as a scalable model for other institutions seeking to expand strategies to advance STEM education through CUREs in biological sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
