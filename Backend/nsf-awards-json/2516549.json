 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the translation from lab to market of a technology for printing electronic materials onto three dimensional surfaces using aerosol jets. This technology uses a computer-controlled printing system to create electronic circuits for three-dimensional objects/surfaces, allowing for the integration of digital features into everyday objects. This solution addresses the complexity of designing and then manufacturing electronics for a variety of surfaces and shapes in a reliable manner. Aerosol jet printing is an emerging field with broad relevance for energy, healthcare, aerospace, automotive, and consumer electronics sectors. The commercialization of this technology has the potential to benefit the U.S. economy and society by integrating electronic functionality on complex surfaces to support miniaturization, improved performance, and reduced cost for sensing, communicating, and performing other digital tasks across a broad spectrum of markets. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of conformal printed electronics. Aerosol jet printing is a digital, non-contact patterning method well-suited to the precision fabrication of electronics on nonplanar surfaces. This new solution integrates two technologies into a coherent workflow. First, real-time process monitoring capabilities improve manufacturing reliability, standardization, and automation. Second, the technology is integrated with conformal motion planning tools and multi-axis printing hardware for nonplanar patterning. The benefits of this approach include accelerating design iterations for functional prototyping, streamlining the transition from prototype to manufacturing, and allowing a broader base of users to engage in new forms of digitally-enabled design and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
