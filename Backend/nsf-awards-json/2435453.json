 "awd_abstract_narration": "Space infrastructure plays a critical role in socio-economic development-enabling scientific discoveries and advancing communications, remote sensing, geophysical and astrophysical applications. The exponential growth in the launch of space objects in orbits around the Earth over the last few years has made space more congested and has contributed to increased space debris. Additionally, the increased government and commercial interest in lunar and Mars missions pose both potential benefits and risks to safe and sustainable space operations. The primary goal of the Center for Research in Emerging Sustainable Space Technologies (CRES2T), a partnership between the Pennsylvania State University, Texas A&M University, and Purdue University, is to research novel concepts and associated technologies that enable safe and responsible use of space for humanity. CRES2T researchers will investigate the intricate relationship between hardware and software design, autonomy, artificial intelligence, and modeling and simulation to enable safe in-space assembly, service and manufacturing (ISAM) while addressing the unique challenges posed by the harsh space environment. The secondary goal of this center is to stimulate the next-generation workforce by training the next-generation workforce in this critical area of national need. CRES2T activities have the potential to impact the new global space economy, create new jobs, and advance our nation\u2019s economic, scientific, technological, and national security interests. \r\n\r\nThe CRES2T activities will focus on an ecosystem where researchers not only conduct research and development of individual technologies related to sustainable space operations but also focus on integrating different technological advances in a seamless manner to accelerate transitioning of these advances to commercial entities. The research thrusts and the operation of CRES2T are formulated to address the complex and rapid commercial pulls involved in developing space technology. Purdue University\u2019s College of Engineering identified the emerging space sector as a critical area for its entire College of Engineering. Through the Purdue Engineering\u2019s Cislunar Initiative, Purdue is leveraging its existing strengths in mission design, space debris analysis and propulsion to advance access to cislunar space; characterize and enable the utilization of resources from the Moon and near-Earth objects; and conceive the infrastructure necessary for cislunar space development and habitability. As the orbital economy grows, new challenges are also emerging in space traffic management and policy, and defense of the nation\u2019s space-based assets. Purdue team will work closely with other sites (Penn State and Texas A&M) to test these technologies in a seamless manner and developing the US operational workforce through student internships, annual workshops, short courses, and virtual tutorials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
