 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mitigating corrosion is a grand challenge that costs the United States over half a trillion dollars annually. Current corrosion control measures, which mainly rely on chemical coatings, often come with high cost and risks to human and environmental health. Microorganisms play key roles in corrosion, in which they can either accelerate or inhibit corrosion of metal surfaces. In this project, the researchers will develop a biological coating system that can be applied for corrosion control of civil infrastructure. This bio-inspired coating design takes advantage of naturally occurring microorganisms that strongly inhibit corrosion. By harnessing the power of microorganisms and microbial biofilms, the biological coating developed through this project will provide long-lasting protection against corrosion to many types of metal-based infrastructure, improving their resilience.\r\n\r\nTo develop this biological anti-corrosion coating, the researchers hypothesize that both the chemistry and microbiology of the coating material need to be deliberately designed and fabricated. This biotechnology development also requires co-production with a convergent team of interdisciplinary academic researchers and experts from industry and government. To accomplish these goals, this Phase 2 project will (1) develop a scalable prototype of the microbial coating system through accelerated technology development and maturation through partnerships, and (2) build a sustainability plan including trust building with potential end-users of the biotechnology. Both objectives will be carried out through an iterative and collaborative approach between the academic, industry, and government project partners, including experts in environmental and civil engineering, mechanical engineering, synthetic biology, polymer chemistry, mathematics, and advanced manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
