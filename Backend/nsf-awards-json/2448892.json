 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Brigham Young University (BYU) to enable modernized long-term preservation of over 530,000 herbarium specimens, including digital imaging and baseline recording of specimen data for 225,000 specimens not yet databased. Digitized specimen data produced through this project will be searchable and available via the internet to land managers and agency personnel, which will enhance sound management policies based on species distribution data. These data will also be searchable by the public, enabling opportunities for exploring nature and species diversity of the intermountain west by anyone. This project will involve training and leadership opportunities for one graduate student and many undergraduate students in a mentored-learning environment that emphasizes curatorial practices and various uses of specimen-based data. Student expertise will contribute to an expansive public Tree of Life exhibit being developed by the museum that highlights critical but often overlooked aspects and impacts of species diversity on everyday life.\r\n\r\nThe Brigham Young University Herbarium is the largest herbarium in the intermountain west in size, species representation, and geographic breadth. This project will provide cabinetry and installation onto a compact storage system already installed by the university. The new storage system will preserve the value of existing specimens, by eliminating overcrowding that can lead to specimen damage, and will also provide space for future growth. The project will also support purchase of new cameras for higher-resolution imaging of specimens. Then, as specimens are moved into the new cabinetry, the images will be incorporated into a modernized organizational system that includes essential digital specimen information to improve the use of the collection by clientele. At the completion of this project, the entire BYU herbarium will be searchable online.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
