 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are being adopted at an unprecedented rate, offering powerful new capabilities for researchers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. While these tools can accelerate discovery, they also present significant challenges such as providing inaccurate or limited information. This project aims to develop guidelines for STEM education researchers so that they can use these novel tools effectively and responsibly. This project addresses a critical gap by bringing together experts from a variety of fields at a conference to develop foundational guidance for the responsible use of AI in STEM education and research. This work serves the national interest by lessening the risk of using AI in STEM education.\r\n\r\nThe rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI tools in the research workflow has outpaced the development of professional standards for their use. Thus, this project convenes a conference of experts to create guidance for the responsible use of AI within the context of STEM education research. The project centers on expanding the understanding that STEM education researchers have of the complex issues involved with the use of AI and seeks to establish a framework for decision-making. The conference and subsequent activities address two central research questions: (1) what are the opportunities, challenges, and risks pertaining to the use of AI tools in STEM education research? and (2) what ethical issues, including authorship and data privacy, should STEM education researchers consider when using AI tools in their research? The project contributes to the development and dissemination of AI guidelines that will inform and enhance STEM education research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
