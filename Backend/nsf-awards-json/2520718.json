 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forensic peer review is the task of reviewing published studies to uncover errors or manipulation in data, analyses or theories. Forensic peer reviewers might identify problems that were undetected during traditional peer review processes. This project brings together reviewers, authors, research integrity officers, and platform designers to co-develop guidelines and practical tools that promote fair, constructive, and collaborative forensic peer review practices. The project brings together a wide range of stakeholders, including citizen scientists, journalists, and early-career researchers.\r\n\r\nThe project combines digital ethnography, interviews, and participatory design to explore and improve the landscape of forensic peer review. In Phase One, the research team will document a set of forensic investigations and conduct interviews with forensic reviewers and authors to understand their values, needs, and experiences. In Phase Two, the project team will convene interdisciplinary workshops to co-create guidelines and prototype interventions, such as communication protocols, community moderation strategies, and author alert tools. During Phase Three, the team will pilot and evaluate these outputs in collaboration with existing and emerging review platforms. The project outcomes include research publications, public datasets, and actionable resources to guide forensic peer review.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
