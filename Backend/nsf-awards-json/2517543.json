 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) requests funds for oceanographic instrumentation that are needed to carry out NSF-supported scientific research on board the R/V Langseth, a research vessel operating as part of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF). The specific instrument requested is a DgS digital gravity meter to replace an older BGM-3 marine gravimeter that suffered a catastrophic failure. The new instrument will help ensure the vessel maintains its high-level capabilities to support NSF-funded research.\r\n\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 23-525). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance, and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or other organization access to well-maintained, high-quality, calibrated instruments for their research. It ensures the collection of high-quality oceanographic data in support of science, reduces the cost of that research, and expands the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
