 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of recycled fiber-natural fiber blends. The technology uses mechanical recycling to turn discarded apparel into high quality fibers. The U.S. throws away over 17 million tons of apparel and textiles every year. Less than 15% of discarded textiles in the U.S. are recycled, which means a valuable resource is going to waste. By blending these recycled fibers with new plant- or animal-based fibers, the collective fiber length is long enough for spinning into new yarn and manufacturing new textiles. The solution utilizes perennial flax, where the fiber can be harvested in spring and fall with minimal inputs and no tilling for several years.  the use of perennial flax preserves soil from erosion and promotes soil health. Wool from alpaca and sheep provide the long carrier fibers for the mechanically recycled fibers which allow textiles made from these recycled-natural fiber blends to be mechanically recycled again. As the procurement of these grown or recycled fibers as well as manufacturing yarn can happen locally, this can create a regional circular textile economy.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of recycled fiber-natural blends that meet textile manufacturers' specifications. This solution connects regional industries to create new jobs in recycling, agriculture, and manufacturing for rural economic development. Two novel technologies are combined to create recycled yarn from discarded apparel: a mechanical fiber shredder textile recycling technology, that recycles textiles into fibers and threads and a novel perennial flax breed that provides an alternative to more resource-intensive annual flax - with long fibers suitable for spinning into yarn. Utilizing existing mini mill yarn spinning technologies, these fibers combine to form functional yarns of many colors, weights, and plies. Replacing products' new fiber with recycled fiber reduces water use, land use, and air pollution. Recycled fibers come in an array of colors, removing the need to dye textiles thus reducing water pollution. The fiber shredder recycles post-consumer and post-industrial waste for companies to make new textile products. This solution helps more manufacturers, retailers, and brands take realistic steps towards building textile supply chains.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
