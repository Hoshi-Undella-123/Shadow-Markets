 "awd_abstract_narration": "This goal of this project is to turn two greenhouse gases  \u2014 carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) and methane (CH\u2084) \u2014 into methanol, which is a useful chemical and a cleaner fuel. The process uses a plasma, which is a special state of matter made from superheated particles, with clean energy such as solar power. Instead of capturing and storing CO\u2082, this project takes it from the air near places where methane is released and turns it into methanol. This approach could reduce costs, make use of the U.S.'s natural gas supplies, and improve national security. It could also boost the economy by creating new markets for these gases. The project will train college students in science and technology and include hands-on activities to interest younger students in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nWhile conventional thermal dry methane reforming (DMR) transforms CO2 and CH4 into CO and H2, the project team has demonstrated that the use of perovskites and a non-thermal plasma route promotes the direct production of methanol. Successful completion of this project will advance the understanding of the plasma-catalyst interactions at the nanoscale responsible for the oxygenate yield. Another intellectual contribution will be the development of plasma-activated/plasma-enhancing perovskites and dual-function metal-perovskites for CO2 capture and conversion, which can be applied across a wide range of approaches. Additionally, a comparative study of the thermal vs. plasma route will provide insights into the isolated effects of the fields and plasma-charged particles. The objectives for this project are to fundamentally understand: (1) the interactions between plasma-originated species and perovskites under different plasma scenarios and their implications for reactivity, (2) the mechanistic impact of plasma properties and composition and individual species during CO2 conversion, (3) the material response (charging, polarization, electric field) to plasma and surface properties of perovskites that enable the CO2 catalytic conversion to methanol, (4) the link between surface properties and plasma conditions and the boundaries between thermal and plasma effects, and (5) the link between material composition and CO2 binding and reactivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
