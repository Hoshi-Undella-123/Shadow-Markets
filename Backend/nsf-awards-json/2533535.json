 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Early Graduate Research in Applied Mathematics (EaGR) workshop will take place June 23-27, 2025 at the American Institute of Mathematics in Pasadena, CA. Participants are rising second- and third-year graduate students in US-based PhD programs in applied mathematics. This workshop will provide participants with the skills and confidence to transition smoothly to the next stage of their graduate program through tutorials, professional development activities, and research talks. \r\n\r\nOrganized in response to the increasing role of data and technology in all areas of the mathematical sciences, particularly in applied mathematics, the workshop will provide training in computational skills such as statistics, data science, optimization, and machine learning. Established experts in industry and academia will facilitate a series of minicourses and hands-on lab activities. The workshop will include professional development sessions focused on success in graduate school and beyond, giving students access to career mentoring and support outside of their institution and advisor. More information can be found at https://aimath.org/workshops/upcoming/eagr-am/ and https://aimath.org/pastworkshops/eagr-am.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
