 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of an automatic, portable pill dispenser designed to improve medication adherence that advances the national health. This technology is suitable for elderly individuals, patients with chronic conditions, and those with complex medication regimes. Medication non-adherence is reported as the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S., contributing to approximately 125,000 deaths for persons with treatable ailments and up to 25% of hospital readmissions. Additionally, medical non-adherence results in over $500 billion in preventable healthcare costs. These problems are addressable by using an automatic, portable pill dispenser that offers an accessible, patient-centered solution that caregivers can also use in organizing, dispensing, and tracking medication intake more effectively. By reducing the risk of medication error and missing doses, the device aims to lower the frequency of hospital readmission, promote the quality of life of patients, and lower healthcare costs. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of an automated pill dispenser. This technology enables the creation of a highly compact product that remains capable of storing and dispensing multiple different medications. The simple yet effective pill dispensing method fits within the palm of a user\u2019s hand, while including the traditional components of pill dispensers that customers expect. The pill dispensing technology advances the state of the art in medical technology by providing a clever and compact mechanism that is poised for widespread adoption by potential customers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
