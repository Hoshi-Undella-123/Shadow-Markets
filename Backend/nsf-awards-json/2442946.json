 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will support research that contributes to new knowledge of a nanomanufacturing process for conductive polymers. Conductive polymers with nanoscale patterns can significantly enhance the performance of nanoelectronics, including advanced nanosensors and energy devices, for a wide range of next-generation applications. However, nanopatterning of conductive polymers remains scientifically challenging because conductive polymers are not compatible with existing patterning techniques. This award supports fundamental research to address knowledge gaps in creating probe-based hybrid nanopatterning processes that enable high-resolution and tunable patterning of conductive polymers. The new process will promote the progress of science and accelerate innovations in advanced organic nanoelectronics manufacturing. Given the increasing demand for organic nanoelectronics across numerous research fields and industries, this project is expected to contribute to economic growth and national prosperity in the United States. In addition to research, this award will support educational programs to enhance engineering workforce training. The research-enriched education plan will cultivate highly skilled workforces for advanced manufacturing. Outreach efforts through various initiatives and programs will engage local K-12 students, fostering awareness and sparking interest in engineering careers.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this CAREER project is to create and understand a probe-based hybrid nanopatterning process to enable high-resolution and versatile patterning of conductive polymers. To achieve this objective, the project will: (1) pilot a probe-based hybrid nanopatterning process that integrates electric fields and mechanical vibrations to pattern conductive polymers at the nanoscale using both top-down and bottom-up approaches; (2) investigate the fundamental mechanisms of hybrid nanopatterning conductive polymers by experimentally analyzing and modeling the effects of process parameters and material properties on the patterned nanofeatures; and (3) fabricate and evaluate the performance of advanced organic nanoelectronic devices produced using the developed probe-based nanopatterning process. By modeling energy exposures from the combined effects of electric fields and mechanical vibrations, the project will provide insights into the probe-based hybrid nanopatterning of conductive polymers. The quality and reliability assessments of the fabricated organic nanoelectronic devices will validate the fidelity of the probe-based nanopatterning process, understand the nanoelectronics damage mechanisms, and lay the foundation for advanced organic nanoelectronics manufacturing innovations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
