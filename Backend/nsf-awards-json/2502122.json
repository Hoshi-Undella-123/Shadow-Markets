 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials are only nanometers thick.  They consist of one or several layers of atoms.  They have a relatively large surface area.  Amino acids (AAs), the building blocks of proteins, can be attached to 2D materials to build novel devices for engineering and biomedical applications.  Examples include catalysis, drug delivery, and sensors.  However, the relationships between the chemistry of AA-anchored 2D materials and their structures and properties are not well understood.  This project will synthesize a collection of AA-anchored 2D silicoaluminophosphates and aluminosilicates, examine their morphology and surface chemistry, and demonstrate applications of the materials.  Applications include extracting rare earth elements from brine solutions and providing a scaffold for cell growth. The project will support education of undergraduates in advanced materials and will conduct outreach activities through the Fenn Academy and National Chemistry Week to engage K-12 students in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to create a series of AA-anchored 2D materials, understand their physicochemical properties, and explore their potential in engineering and biomedical applications. The research aims to elucidate the influence of AA molecular structures on the formation of 2D materials when AAs are applied as secondary structure directing agents. A range of characterization techniques, such as transmission electron microscopy, colorimetric titration and temperature programmed desorption of ammonia and CO2, will be utilized to reveal the morphology and surface chemistry of the synthesized 2D materials. The AA-anchored 2D materials will be evaluated as adsorbents for selective extraction of rare earth elements from brine solutions. The results will highlight the critical roles of surface chemistry and morphology in adsorption performance. Biomedical application potential of AA-anchored 2D materials will also be demonstrated. The 2D materials will be integrated into 3D printed scaffolds for Schwann cell proliferation. The modified scaffolds will be used to assess the effectiveness of AA-rich surfaces for promoting cell growth. Furthermore, the tunability of degradation rates of AA-anchored 2D materials in biofluids, which is critical for applications such as drug delivery and bioelectronics, will be demonstrated with materials of different physicochemical properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
