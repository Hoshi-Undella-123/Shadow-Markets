 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proteins are large, flexible macromolecules that perform a vast range of functions in all living organisms. Their functions span from copying genetic material to providing structural integrity to cells and organisms. Because of their size, flexibility, and chemistry, proteins can undergo structural changes that dictate their function and sometimes cause disease. The ability to understand and predict how the conditions that proteins experience affect their structure and conformation, and in turn their functioning in solution, is essential for science and technology. This award will be used for the development of predictive models for both fundamental physics of complex fluids and some industrial applications, including the development of first-principle models in manufacturing of biologics, pharmaceutical products composed of proteins, nucleic acids, or cells. Microgravity makes it possible to study how protein solutions flow, without complications associated with the interaction of protein solutions and solid walls. \r\n\r\nThis project utilizes the microgravity environment of the International Space Station (ISS), where surface tension becomes a dominant force, this allows the study of protein solutions in the ring-sheared drop module, a container-less biochemical reactor. In this research, fluid dynamics will be used as a probe to gain fundamental insight on protein structure and function, especially at interfaces with fluidity. Simultaneously, proteins are used to gain fundamental insight into fluid dynamics. Drops of protein solutions with surfaces that are curved inward, curved outward, or not curved will be generated and studied on the ISS. The influence of flow speed and associated fluid inertia will be examined in addition to the effects of curvature on the flow. The experiments in microgravity will be augmented by experiments with analogs in the laboratory on Earth. The bulk and at the interface will also be developed and tested using novel experimental techniques for distinguishing fluid flow. Results are expected to be important not only for biomedical applications, but also for applications ranging from 3D printing to oil recovery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
