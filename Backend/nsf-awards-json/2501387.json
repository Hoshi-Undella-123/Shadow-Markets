 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of plasma turbulence at the boundary of space environments holds profound implications for our understanding of space weather, planetary magnetospheres, and astrophysical systems. This research focuses on the dynamic interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere, particularly within the turbulent magnetosheath. By analyzing this environment, we aim to enhance our knowledge of how plasma conditions evolve across boundaries especially in inaccessible regions in the universe such as the heliosphere interface with the interstellar medium, and supernovae remnants. The project is significant as it addresses key challenges in space physics, including the complex interplay of nonlinear interactions and the multiscale nature of turbulence, which remain difficult to model and simulate. This project will also contribute to developing novel algorithms for the upcoming era of multiscale multispacecraft missions. \r\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective, this study employs a combination of theoretical modeling, numerical simulations, and spacecraft observations to investigate plasma turbulence in the vicinity of Earth\u2019s bow shock. The interaction of the solar wind with the bow shock produces a downstream region (the magnetosheath) with unique properties. It is a very turbulent medium of limited size where the dynamical evolution of the recently shocked solar wind can be investigated. The research focuses on three primary objectives: (1) extending our understanding of the inertial range of turbulence, (2) measuring energy dissipation rates, and (3) characterizing equilibrium states that emerge in turbulent flows. We utilize advanced multispacecraft techniques, such as the Lag Polyhedra Derivative Ensemble (LPDE), alongside high-resolution data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission and hybrid particle-in-cell simulations using the Menura code. The results will provide a more comprehensive picture of turbulence across planetary magnetospheres and interstellar boundaries, contributing to the broader field of space plasma physics and informing future space missions like HelioSwarm, PUNCH, and IMAP.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
