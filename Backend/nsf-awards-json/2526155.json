 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses a national need for a skilled workforce in emerging technology sectors by providing high school participants with immersive learning experiences in unmanned aerial systems (UAS). As drone applications expand across industries such as infrastructure, logistics, public safety, and environmental monitoring, workforce preparation in this area is critical to national innovation, economic competitiveness, and technological leadership. By introducing participants to applied engineering, systems thinking, and real-world problem solving, the project strengthens the STEM pipeline and connects young learners to future-facing career opportunities. In addition to skill-building, the project enhances the capacity of educators and school counselors to advise students on pathways into technical fields such as aerospace, automation, and robotics. \r\n\r\nThe project engages participants from public high schools in structured, scaffolded learning that builds from foundational technical skills to advanced drone system design, testing, and mission execution. Participants gain hands-on experience in drone assembly, telemetry, sensor integration, and autonomous flight programming, and apply these skills to real-world challenges such as flight planning and payload deployment. The program features a two-year cohort model that fosters peer collaboration and continuity of learning. Undergraduate and graduate mentors provide technical coaching and guidance on academic and career pathways. Industry and university partners support participant development through feedback, design reviews, and exposure to engineering standards used in aerospace and automation sectors. Field trips to drone facilities and aerospace companies, along with the opportunity to participate in a summer internship program, further immerse participants in STEM environments and expand their understanding of professional opportunities. The project aligns with community college training programs and offers insight into multiple career paths, including four-year degrees and direct workforce entry. Outcomes will be assessed through participant engagement, skill development, mentor involvement, and postsecondary tracking, creating a replicable model for expanding access to STEM careers and advancing national workforce priorities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
