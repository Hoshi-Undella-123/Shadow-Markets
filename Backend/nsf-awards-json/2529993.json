 "awd_abstract_narration": "STEM graduate education is critical to preparing a workforce capable of advancing national priorities in research, innovation, and economic development. Yet, many STEM graduate programs offer limited preparation, and students may be underprepared to meet workforce demands. At Sam Houston State University (SHSU), STEM graduate program completion rates are approximately 30%, with attrition rates near 70%, representative of regional comprehensive universities. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Award supports a redesign of STEM graduate training to improve retention, degree completion, and workforce readiness. This IGE project will inform institutional strategies for strengthening STEM pathways, contribute to the development of a technically skilled, industry-aligned workforce, and generate knowledge on STEM graduate education interventions.\r\n\r\nThe project embeds structured career exploration, applied skills development, and mentoring into existing graduate pathways to improve transitions into and through STEM graduate programs. The project includes three integrated programs: 1) a post-baccalaureate Career Mindset Program to support graduate transitions and STEM career exploration across sectors; 2) professional development workshops focused on technical writing, time management, and grant preparation; and 3) a Faculty and Graduate Student Mentoring Network, guided by evidence-based STEM practices. Students will participate in peer accountability groups and career readiness activities. \r\n\r\nThe project leverages partnerships with industry and private sectors, government agencies and SHSU alumni to align STEM graduate education with workforce needs. It contributes to regional and national economic development by preparing STEM graduates for technical, research, and applied careers in STEM. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected and analyzed annually to determine the program impact. In addition, the project includes a research component designed to generate generalizable knowledge on graduate education interventions. Research will be conducted by SHSU faculty using social cognitive theory, structural equation modeling, and multivariable regression to determine which components are most effective and scalable. This project emphasizes broad participation and will prepare the next generation of STEM professionals to advance the nation\u2019s STEM enterprise.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
