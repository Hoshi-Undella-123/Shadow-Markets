 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will help support the Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP), a multi-national, non-governmental, and interdisciplinary program for supporting life sciences. HFSP has the goal of promoting and funding \u201cbasic research focused on elucidating sophisticated and complex mechanisms of living organisms for the benefit of all human kind, through international cooperation.\u201d   Societal impact is achieved on multiple fronts, including for the academic community, the innovation ecosystem, and society at large.  A key element of the program will be to provide training and mentoring for U.S. postdoctoral researchers and support for investigators in the U.S. through team awards. \r\n\r\nSince 1990, HFSP has supported highly competitive, bottom-up science by making awards based on high-risk, frontier character, originality, scientific excellence, and the potential to advance knowledge.  The life science topics supported are broad, multidisciplinary, and continually evolving.  Supported efforts include:  a Research Grant Program, a Fellowship Program, Master Classes, Frontier Workshops, and Accelerator Grants. The international nature of the HFSP provides an important complement to the science usually supported by the member funding agencies, thereby helping to support groundbreaking frontier science that might not be possible otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation Directorate for Biological Sciences and by the National Institutes of Health Fogarty Center.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
