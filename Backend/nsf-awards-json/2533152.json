 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Fall Symposium Series is an annual event, traditionally held on the East Coast of the United States in late October or early November. Designed to foster deeper engagement, the series provides a smaller, more intimate forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and explore advances in artificial intelligence. Each year, the symposium topics vary to reflect emerging trends and challenges in AI. The setting is intentionally relaxed and workshop-like, encouraging interactive discussions and collaboration. Typically, the series includes around seven parallel symposia, each attracting 40 to 75 participants, with total attendance ranging from approximately 300 to 500 individuals annually.  This project provides funding for students from US colleges and universities to participate in the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe AAAI Fall 2025 Symposium will feature eight symposia on forward-looking topics in artificial intelligence. These events serve as incubators for interdisciplinary research by bringing together participants from computer science, cyber security, health, ethics, and social sciences. Students will benefit from close interactions with senior researchers through presentations, workshops, and collaborative working sessions. The curated nature of each symposium ensures high-quality engagement and mentoring opportunities. The program will include rigorous selection and accountability mechanisms, ensuring that travel support recipients are actively involved in symposium activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
