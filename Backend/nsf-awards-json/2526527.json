 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the third biennial Ecosystem for Collaborative Leadership and Inclusive innovation in Plasma Science and Engineering (ECLIPSE) meeting, planned to take place from May 18-20, 2026 on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The meeting is intended to bring together the community supported by NSF and Partner Agencies across the breadth of plasma science and engineering. The meeting will provide a unique opportunity for the plasma science and engineering community to exchange ideas and scientific results on the full range of topics in the field from high-energy plasma astrophysics and geospace plasmas, to the fundamental physics of light-matter interactions and plasma-based particle acceleration, to environmental and industrial applications of low temperature plasmas.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the ECLIPSE meeting series include (1) broadening scientific community\u2019s exposure to the field of plasma science and engineering, (2) highlighting the interconnections between the physics foundations of the field and its many applications and (3) enabling members of the plasma science and engineering community to network across traditional disciplinary boundaries. The meeting will include invited and contributed talks with generous time for questions and answers, a poster session, facility tours, and opportunities for discussion of potential for future cross-agency collaboration in addressing national science and technology challenges and priorities.  The meeting presentations will be webcast with the opportunity for online viewing and an online discussion forum for members of the community who are not able to participate in person.\r\n\r\nThis award is jointly supported by the Division of Physics, the Division of Astronomical Sciences, the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences, and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
