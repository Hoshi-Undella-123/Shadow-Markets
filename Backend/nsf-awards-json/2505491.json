 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Chenjie Zeng of the University of Florida will develop generalizable methodologies for the synthesis of nanosized, atomically precise clusters of semiconductors. Semiconductor nanomaterials, such as quantum dots, have useful properties for electronic and photonic applications. The ability to synthesize semiconductor nanoclusters with atomic-level control over their sizes, shapes, surfaces, and compositions would enable understanding of their structure-property relationship and provide insights into the developing of technologically important materials. The interdisciplinary nature of the project will provide comprehensive research training for graduate and undergraduate students, equipping them with the integrated knowledge and skills to address complex challenges in nanochemistry and nanotechnology. Additionally, outreach activities will introduce semiconductor nanomaterials to the public and K-12 students, fostering broader interest in nanoscience.\r\n\r\nThe Zeng research group aims to develop generalizable methodologies that are based on cation exchange reaction for enabling atomic-level control of the structures and properties of II-VI semiconductor nanoclusters and expanding the library of atomically precise nanoclusters. Specifically, Aim 1 will develop an approach for controlling the surface structures of II-VI clusters by tailoring metal-ligand complexes; Aim 2 will focus on tuning the core sizes and shapes of II-VI clusters by adjusting metal-chalcogenide template clusters; and Aim 3 will explore pathways for homovalent cation exchange to achieve atomically defined heterostructures. The expanded library may serve as a model system for atomic-level understanding of the structures of semiconductor nanoclusters, the collaborative roles of various ligands in passivating nanocluster surface, and the detailed mechanisms underlying cation exchange reactions. Access to this library of II-VI nanoclusters may also offer a robust testing ground for high-level theoretical calculations, enabling the development of consistent models to describe their electronic structures. The fundamental understanding may facilitate the rational control of semiconductor nanocluster properties for emerging optical, electronic, and spin-based applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
