 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of simulation technologies for training surgeons in ear- and hearing-related healthcare. In this field, trainees must learn to use high-speed drills safely in the head and near vital structures like the brain, large blood vessels, and nerves. The work is precise, and the risks are high, so practicing on simulators before operating on patients is essential. The current gold standard for training is dissection of donated human temporal bones in simulation laboratories, where learners receive instruction, feedback, and evaluation from expert ear surgeons. This method teaches anatomy, hand skills, and proper techniques in surgery. However, the number of donated cadaveric temporal bones is decreasing, which limits access to hands-on training. Outside of the United States, the shortage is even worse. Many countries lack cadaveric materials, dissection equipment, and formal instruction. As a result, tens of thousands of trainees around the world have little to no access to basic surgical simulation for ear surgeries. Still, training programs must meet learners\u2019 needs, the skill benchmarks required for accreditation, and the public\u2019s expectations for high-quality surgical care. This growing demand is fueling interest in new surgical simulation technologies and opening opportunities in a $70 million global market.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a unique surgical training kit designed to be affordable, portable, and regularly accessible. Each kit contains a series of 3D-printed artificial temporal bones, mock surgical instruments, and access to online, video-based instructional modules. The complete curriculum is flexible and self-directed, allowing learners to set up in minutes and train in any location, including at home. The training kits are distributed through a monthly subscription box and digital service. This delivery model provides consistent, structured exposure to simulated tissues, essential tools, and instructional resources. By offering safe, cost-effective, and repeatable practice opportunities, the solution aims to enhance surgical training for more trainees who can learn and offer patients more effective ear- and hearing-related procedures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
