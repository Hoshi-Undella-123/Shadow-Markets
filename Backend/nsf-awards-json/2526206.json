 "awd_abstract_narration": "Magnetism is a fundamental enabling technology that underpins modern electronics, data storage, transportation, and medical diagnostics. Advancing knowledge in this field is critical for continued innovation, and a summer school will significantly contribute by providing participants with intensive training at the forefront of magnetics research. The 2025 IEEE Magnetics Society Summer School is a week-long international educational program focused on nanomagnetism. It will be held June 21\u201325, 2025 at the Center for Memory and Recording Research (CMRR) at the University of California, San Diego. Lectures by world-leading experts will expose students to state-of-the-art experimental techniques and theoretical developments, broadening their understanding beyond what is available at their home institutions. Through interactive discussions and opportunities to present their own research, students will sharpen their critical thinking and scientific communication skills. This immersive intellectual environment is designed to spark new research ideas and collaborations among the participants, as they exchange perspectives and learn directly from pioneers in magnetism. By cultivating deeper expertise and a network of professional relationships, the summer school will empower these early career researchers to make novel contributions to magnetics research, thereby propelling the field forward.\r\n\r\nThe summer school will have strong emphasis on global engagement and knowledge dissemination. By bringing together students from around the world the program broadens participation in STEM and encourages interactions within the magnetics and other research communities. Attendees receive financial support to attend, removing economic barriers and ensuring that selection is based on talent and potential. The international students and faculty create a global network of peers and mentors, fostering cross-cultural collaboration and long-term professional relationships that can drive future scientific advancements. After the program, participants will share the knowledge and skills gained with colleagues at their home universities through seminars, research collaborations, and mentoring, thereby multiplying the impact. Lecture materials and resources from the school will be made freely available online, allowing students and educators beyond the event to benefit from the content. The participation of industrial partners will contribute to industry-academia knowledge exchange and provide internship and R&D employment opportunities. In the long term, strengthening skilled magnetics researchers will benefit society by catalyzing innovations in technologies that rely on magnetism, spanning energy, communications, and information storage. It will also help build a more globally connected scientific workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
