 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of an Integrated Measurement System (IMS) to support multi-disciplinary microelectronics research, education, and training. The acquisition of this instrument will enable a large group of researchers and students to access advanced instrumentation and conduct cutting-edge microelectronics research. In addition, this new instrument will be available to researchers from other institutions as well as industry in the Gulf Coast region. The IMS will provide a hub for researchers to share resources and expertise related to microelectronics and develop new ideas and technologies. Overall, this project will be of significant importance for driving research progress and innovation in microelectronics at the university and in the entire Alabama and Gulf Coast regions.\r\n\r\nThe proposed IMS provides high-precision probing and measurement capabilities that will enable new research spanning microchips, materials, devices, and systems. For example, energy-efficient computing circuits and systems will be implemented for mobile videos applications; new microchips will be designed and tested for artificial intelligence (AI) applications; and novel AI systems and devices will be developed and verified for cancer detection and several other medical applications. \r\n\r\nThere are multiple broader impacts of this project. First, this project will help address the urgent need of microelectronics testing equipment in the Alabama region. The research outcomes enabled by this project will result in technological innovation and will increase the competitiveness of the U.S. in microelectronics research and design. Second, the proposed IMS will be critical for workforce education and training to equip the next generation of engineers and scientists to work with microelectronics and related technologies through curricular innovation and high-quality hands-on learning. Finally, the proposed IMS will significantly enhance training opportunities for local middle and high school teachers and promote K-12 microelectronics education. The website for this project will be: https://nagong.weebly.com/research.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
