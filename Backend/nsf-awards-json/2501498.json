 "awd_abstract_narration": "The FAA projects that the use of Uncrewed or Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) will grow by 1.9 million units by 2028, resulting in the potential to create 472,000 pilot jobs in sectors such as construction, energy, agriculture, communications, insurance photography, real estate, industrial inspection, and emergency services. The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive UAS program to graduate students capable of addressing this growing demand in the nation\u2019s aviation technologies workforce. St. Philips College (SPC) will create a Career and Technical Education (CTE) pathway that will lead to an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree in commercial drone operations. The resulting program will be the only UAS program in the greater San Antonio-Bexar County-South Texas area. This project will leverage the expertise of faculty and industry professionals to advance drone operations education preparing students to work as UAS pilots in high-demand occupations.\r\n\r\nThe project will be faculty-led and consist of two plans of study: (1) Associate of Applied Science Degree Program, and (2) High School Dual-Credit Program. These programs will align to provide a precise sequence of education courses and technical credentials in UAS operations to create a CTE pathway bridging high school learning to a two-year college, industry certifications, and careers. The project will feature courses on drones and drone operations, maintenance, data analysis, and regulatory compliance. Partnerships with industries and government agencies will provide students with internship opportunities and practical experience. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
