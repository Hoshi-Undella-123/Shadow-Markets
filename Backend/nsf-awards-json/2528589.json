 "awd_abstract_narration": "The annual Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA) is a leading computing forum for research on parallel and distributed algorithms, data structures, and models. Participation in SPAA is a valuable aspect of the graduate school experience that furthers student careers and outcomes. This project will enable United States-based student participation, helping them forge new connections and collaborations and thereby advancing computing research in societally beneficial ways, contributing to the development of a more competitive workforce.\r\n\r\nThe scope of SPAA spans both theoretical and systems research in parallel and memory-efficient algorithms. The goal of the project is to support undergraduate and graduate students who currently study in US institutes to attend the SPAA conference to present their research and network with leaders in the community. The funds will be used towards travel and conference registration expenses to reduce the cost of attendance for students and help increase participation. Participation in SPAA will enable student development by (a) enabling students to work on their presentation skills and introduce themselves to the community, (b) providing students an opportunity to learn about the state of the art research on parallel computing in theory, and (c) providing students opportunities for meeting and getting advice from leading researchers across academia and industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
