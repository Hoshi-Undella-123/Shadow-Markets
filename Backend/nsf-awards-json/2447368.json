 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year program will provide ten undergraduates each year with engineering research experiences, professional development, and training in entrepreneurship. Participants will be recruited from two- and four-year colleges. REU students will develop and improve their experimental, analytical, and communication skills. The associated programming will engage students about planning for graduate school and other career opportunities, while also introducing them to entrepreneurial concepts that will help them place their research in wider contexts. In addition, the project will examine student persistence in STEM, specifically encouraging community college students to continue to four-year programs. This project aligns with the mission of the National Science Foundation to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare by increasing participation in engineering and STEM to create a more competitive and skilled workforce.\r\n\r\nThe REU students will have opportunities to engage in research in biomedical, civil, computer, electrical, environmental, materials, and mechanical engineering projects. Projects will include work in areas including turbulent flow, vaccine development, electric grid stability, water quality, and aerogel materials.  The program experiences and activities will: 1) spark students\u2019 interest in engineering and STEM careers; 2) increase students\u2019 persistence in STEM and continuation of community college students to bachelor\u2019s degrees; 3) develop students\u2019 experimental, analytical, and communication skills; and 4) enable the students to place their research in wider contexts (e.g., societal impacts, applications, and potential commercialization).  Students will work directly with faculty mentors in state-of-the-art laboratories while also engaging in professional development activities including entrepreneurship training modeled on the National Science Foundation I-Corps program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
