 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New England Hardware Security workshop is a regional, one-day conference designed to bring together hardware security researchers, industry participants, and students in order to develop connections and collaborations between these groups.  This award will fund student participation in the workshop, reducing the financial burden of attending and thus allowing a wide range of junior students from the region to participate. Student attendees will be able to present their work at poster sessions, allowing them to get feedback from a variety of experts.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide travel support to up to 100 students; the regional nature of the workshop reduces travel costs, accommodating a much wider range of student participants in terms of their career stage and experience in hardware security than most conferences. In particular, the workshop will target early-stage researchers who are not yet attending national conferences, as well as students from disciplinary and personal backgrounds that might not otherwise think to attend a conference on hardware security. This will both increase the chances that participants take up hardware security topics in their future work, grow the hardware research community, and provide participants with ways to connect with potential future employers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
