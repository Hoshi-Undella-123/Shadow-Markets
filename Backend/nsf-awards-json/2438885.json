 "awd_abstract_narration": "As advancements in connected technology and AI produce new threats to national security, the federal government needs proven cybersecurity engineers to protect its people, systems and interests. This project builds upon a 24-year effort at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to strengthen the pipeline of federal cybersecurity professionals while increasing cross-disciplinary collaboration to meet the nation's evolving security needs in the era of AI. To address the unfulfilled demand for skilled security professionals in federal service, this project provides graduate students at CMU\u2019s Information Networking Institute with full scholarships to support their successful pursuit of a master\u2019s degree in information security or artificial intelligence and information security. The foundation of this project is the MS in Information Security (MSIS), CMU\u2019s flagship cybersecurity degree founded in 2003, which is the cornerstone of the university\u2019s designation as a National Center for Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity. Coursework that pairs a deeply technical curriculum in cybersecurity and AI engineering with interdisciplinary skills in policy, ethics, business and research results in Scholarship for Service graduates that are exceptionally prepared for service in the federal executive branch after graduation. Through this project, CMU leverages its expertise in cybersecurity and AI to advance the field and deepen national relationships.\r\n\r\nThis proposal leverages CMU\u2019s existing strengths in cybersecurity and AI research and education to craft new opportunities for advanced research, cross-disciplinary collaboration and intellectual exchange. The MSIS program continues to produce graduates who excel in cybersecurity roles, equipped with the interdisciplinary knowledge and career-ready skills they need to thrive. The M.S. in Artificial Intelligence Engineering - Information Security degree responds to the rapidly evolving cybersecurity field by integrating security foundations and AI engineering, providing students with a deep understanding of AI and machine learning methods, systems, toolchains and cross-cutting issues, including security, privacy and ethical and policy challenges. All participating scholars complete coursework from both degree programs, ensuring that these students are well equipped to handle the intersecting challenges and opportunities of cybersecurity and AI. Through a CyberFX Capstone Semester, Scholarship for Service students apply their skills to projects that will have a direct impact on the broader cybersecurity community, choosing from: security and AI-focused research or application; creation of software or tools to support cybersecurity education; or cybersecurity competitions or hackathons that result in knowledge transfer. Publications will benefit other students, researchers and professionals in the field. \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.\u202f\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
