 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Mississippi State University will develop a smart agriculture energy innovation network (SAGEIN) certification program that integrates distributed renewable energy systems, smart agriculture technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), and entrepreneurship to build workforce capacity for rural communities. The integration of distributed renewable energy systems with smart agriculture represents a critical frontier for addressing interlinked national challenges of energy security, rural economic development, and long-term sustainability under environmental variability while creating new paradigms for sustainable food-energy systems. The SAGEIN program creates a comprehensive training ecosystem where research innovations can be effectively translated into practical solutions that drive rural economic development. The unique stakeholder-driven framework identifies authentic rural energy challenges while providing direct pathways for implementation and technology transfer. The project anticipates training three hundred and fifty (350) MS and PhD students, including fifteen (15) funded trainees, from mechanical engineering, agricultural sciences, economics, and human sciences, preparing them to become research entrepreneurs and technical experts in the rapidly evolving rural energy sector.\r\n\r\nThe SAGEIN program implements a three-phase educational model designed to transform graduate students into research entrepreneurs through integrated technical and professional training pathways. Technical training consists of a 12-credit certification program covering four sequential courses: renewable energy assessment, smart agriculture integration, AI-driven solutions, and entrepreneurial ventures. The research agenda advances knowledge through three convergent themes that test specific hypotheses: (1) integrated local energy systems, including solar, wind, small hydro, and low-carbon thermal technologies, can be co-located with agricultural operations to enhance land-use efficiency and support animal agriculture through optimized physical-biological interactions; (2) mixture-of-expert AI frameworks can effectively balance competing objectives in complex rural energy-agriculture systems; and (3) multi-dimensional resilience metrics can quantify vulnerability across coupled rural distributed energy infrastructure and agricultural operations. The program will advance fundamental knowledge integrating agriculture and energy using intelligent resource management and assessing the resilience of rural infrastructure. Outcomes will include new frameworks for sustainable rural energy development, data-driven tools for system optimization, and practical strategies for bringing innovations to market while preparing a workforce ready to lead in an evolving energy economy.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, and potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
