 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this small business innovation research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in its potential to transform outcomes for US burn injury survivors; a population burdened by disfigurement, physical limitation, and long-term psychological impacts. While current treatments focus primarily on survival, many patients face permanent reductions in quality of life due to scarring and contractures. This project aims to develop a novel burn care system that actively manages serious burn wounds to reduce scarring and provide better patient outcomes. If successful, the technology could reduce long-term complications, support social reintegration, enable return to work, and enhance quality of life. The economic burden on US health systems is also significant: the average cost of care for a serious burn injury requiring hospitalization exceeds $250,000 and may extend for months or even years. Globally, medical systems pay over $2.6 billion annually on the care and rehabilitation of individuals with serious burns. This project addresses a critical unmet need by aiming to improve patient healing outcomes, and as a consequence will also reduce the need for secondary surgical revision and therapy, thereby decreasing the cost burden on health systems across the country.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project seeks to validate a technology that integrates a three-part sequence of topical anti-scarring therapeutics with a purpose-built dressing designed specifically for the unique and challenging conditions present in serious burns. The project will address key technical risk factors of the combination product including infection prevention, biocompatibility, and dressing functionality. Finally, a capstone porcine study will demonstrate the ability of the complete technology to prevent scarring in vivo. This work will establish critical feasibility data necessary for regulatory filings and clinical development, with the ultimate goal of improving health outcomes for patients with severe burns.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
