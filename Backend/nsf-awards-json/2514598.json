 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST), this project aims to study sleep and internal circadian clocks that regulate sleep-wake cycles. These investigations are significant because lack of sleep has been associated with individuals whose occupations require shift-work. How circadian disruptions affect sleep is unknown. This project will identify how circadian disruptions affect the body.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to establish a world-class research center for circadian system biology. The research questions will focus on understanding how circadian rhythms adapt/resynchronize in response to frequently disrupted and ever-changing stimuli.  The Center aims to: identify the neuronal network mechanisms by which light-dark signals are integrated by the circadian clock in the brain; probe the molecular mechanisms for the synchronization of circadian clocks outside of the brain; and  determine the neurocircuitry underlying sleep. Research methods will include spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, computational neurobiology, and in vivo brain imaging. The project\u2019s scope will engage collaborators to leverage additional cutting-edge technologies. The expected results are the identification of cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for circadian disruptions.  Results will be disseminated at meetings and in publications for the scientific and lay communities. Broader impacts include understanding and mitigating the adverse impact of circadian disruptions and training opportunities for students and faculty. The Center of Research excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program provides support to enhance the research capability capabilities of institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
