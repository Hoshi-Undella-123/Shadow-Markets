 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds to support students for travel to the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE 2025) and the ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2025), which are collocated and will take place in Trondheim, Norway in June 2025. FSE is one of the two flagship conferences in the field of Software Engineering, while ISSTA is the premier conference in software analysis and testing, one of the most popular research areas within software engineering. The grant will provide travel and registration support for US-based students. The FSE conference this year will have a doctoral symposium and will also feature the ACM Student Research Competition. Conference attendance is important for the technical exchange of information and research conversations/collaborations made possible by the conference, as well as advances in the field made possible by these interactions. The conference provides opportunities for education, training and mentoring to build the next generation of researchers and practitioners in the field of software engineering. The international nature of this conference helps develop a globally-aware workforce of research and educators within the US and helps build the community of researchers in the field of Software Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
