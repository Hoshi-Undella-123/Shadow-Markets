 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program, Professor Yujie Sun of the University of Cincinnati and Professor Christopher Elles of the University of Kansas are developing advanced photocatalysts that can be activated by near-infrared (NIR) light. This collaborative research effort is harnessing the unique properties of two-photon absorption (TPA) of designed chromophores to drive various chemical transformations under the irradiation of NIR photons, which can penetrate deeper into media and tissues with minimal interference. The project is also expanding the fundamental understanding of NIR light-driven chemistry and enabling applications ranging from sustainable polymer production to targeted biomolecule modification. In addition to its scientific impact, this project is providing interdisciplinary training for students, broadening STEM participation through outreach programs, and contributing new content to chemistry education.\r\n\r\nConventional ultraviolet/visible-light-driven photocatalysis is limited by light penetration and competing light absorption in biological environments. To address these challenges Prof. Sun and Prof. Elles and their research team are developing molecular TPA photocatalysts that can be activated by NIR light excitation. The specific aims of this research program are focused on the design, synthesis, and photophysical characterization of novel molecular chromophores with enhanced TPA cross-sections in the NIR region.  Experimental and computational studies are guiding the molecular design and enabling structure\u2013function correlations for improved photocatalytic performance. Together, these efforts are establishing a transformative platform for NIR photocatalysis with broad implications for synthesis, materials science, and chemical biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
