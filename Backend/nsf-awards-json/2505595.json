 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Charles Henry of Colorado State University is developing innovative methods to create next-generation carbon-based sensors for chemical and biological detection. This project aims to make diagnostic testing faster, more affordable, and more accessible by using laser-induced graphene (LIG), a special form of carbon that can be patterned easily with lasers\u2014to build high-performance sensors. These new sensors could be used to quickly detect diseases and improve healthcare, even in remote or resource-limited settings, as well as aiding in other applications ranging from environmental monitoring to food safety. The project will provide valuable hands-on research experience for students, support workforce development in advanced analytical chemistry, and include outreach activities to engage the broader community. By collaborating with industry and potentially international partners, the project seeks to broaden its impact and help bring cutting-edge sensor technology to real-world applications. As part of the project, we will also develop a learning kit that exposes K-12 students to microfluidics and project-based science. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to enhance the performance and versatility of laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes through precise surface modification using diazonium and click chemistry. The team will develop \u201cclickable\u201d LIG electrodes that can be robustly and selectively functionalized with biomolecules such as antibodies and DNA, improving sensor sensitivity and selectivity while minimizing interference from complex samples. The project will systematically compare these new electrodes to traditional carbon sensor technologies by using advanced electrochemical and spectroscopic methods to characterize their behavior and effectiveness in biosensing applications. Additionally, a novel, water-based method for incorporating these modified electrodes onto microfluidic device substrates will be developed, enabling their integration into capillary-flow driven microfluidic devices for advanced sensing applications. This approach addresses longstanding challenges in electrode fabrication and integration, with the potential to set new standards for scalable, reliable, and high-performance biological sensing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
