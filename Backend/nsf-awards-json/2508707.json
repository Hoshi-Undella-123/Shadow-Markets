 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports US-based participants at two conferences at the Centre de Recherches Math\u00e9matiques (CRM) in Montr\u00e9al, Canada in the spring of 2026: Arithmetic Statistics (March 2\u20136, 2026) and Probability in Number Theory (June 29\u2013July 3, 2026): https://www.crmath.ca/en/activities/#/type/activity/id/3952. These are two important inter-related topics that have been the focus of a great deal of high-level research over the last few years. These events will be part of a larger thematic program on \"Universal Statistics in Number Theory,\" that will be held at the CRM from March to July 2026. This program will give early-career US-based researchers the opportunity to interact with the leading researchers in their field, to present their work in front of these leaders, and to develop new working relationships.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of these conferences is the dissemination of the most recent developments in the area of number theory and statistics, including statistics of L-functions, non-vanishing of L-functions, counting integral points, Selmer groups, and probabilistic number theory.  The statistical side of the program has important links with homology, topology, and algebraic geometry, and the probabilistic side with cryptography, dynamical systems and ergodic theory, and quantum chaos in mathematical physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
