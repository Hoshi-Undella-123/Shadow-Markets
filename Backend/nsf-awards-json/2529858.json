 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of designated institutions of higher education.  Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities for their students to pursue challenging and rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas of national interest, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education.  That appreciation is enhanced considerably by the ability of practitioners to tell the story of their work and its importance to a non-STEM audience.  This project aligns directly with that goal.\r\n\r\nAaniiih Nakoda College conducts this planning project to lay the groundwork for training STEM students at TCUP institutions in journalistic and video media, with the ultimate goal of producing a cadre of STEM professionals who can communicate effectively the background, procedures, and outcomes of their work to the general public.  The planning period establishes internships, engages media professionals, and develops recruitment strategies appropriate to all TCUP institutions.  The planning period designs specific trainings based on STEM discipline areas of interest and expertise.  The findings and outcomes will be shared with organizations that are skilled at STEM media training, with the intended outcome of a variety of options available to TCUP STEM students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
