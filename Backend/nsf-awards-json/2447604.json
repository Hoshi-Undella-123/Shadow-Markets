 "awd_abstract_narration": "Promising undergraduates from two and four-year institutions will work with scientists and engineers to conduct research at one of the nation\u2019s premier scientific centers for Satellite and Ground -Based Remote Sensing. Satellite and ground-based remote sensing is a critically important, unique, and relatively young area of science, and it is practically unknown to most of the undergraduates within the City University of New York (CUNY) system. Activities will combine year-long research experiences with multidimensional/layered mentoring, academic support systems, and a robust learning community that produce holistic and engaging stimuli for the scientific and academic growth and development of the student participants. The students will be engaged in cutting-edge satellite and ground-based remote sensing research of the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the biosphere, the cryosphere, and the lithosphere.  Additionally, the proposed activities will allow the undergraduate researchers to hone their acquired skills and knowledge by being research mentors to high school students in the NYC public school system and to members of the local community.\r\n\r\nThis year-long REU program\u2019s objectives include 1) engage a  cohort of undergraduates each year in collaborative, state-of-the-art satellite and ground-based remote sensing research through mentorship by experts in the field, 2) create and sustain a community and a pipeline of scholars among whom academic excellence in STEM is achieved and the pursuit of baccalaureate degrees, advanced degrees, and STEM careers is encouraged, 3) provide students with the tools, the confidence, and the maturity necessary to succeed in a research-rich environment and to develop their communication (oral and written) and presentation skills, 4) create opportunities for students to meaningfully engage in citizen science by partnering and sharing their urban heat island research results with community residents for whom such results are critically vital, and 5) train students in the ethical and responsible conduct of research as well as the ethical implications of scientific and technological applications in society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
