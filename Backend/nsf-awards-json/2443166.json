 "awd_abstract_narration": "Millions of people rely on hip implants to restore mobility and improve quality of life.  However, these devices sometimes fail over time, leading to costly revision surgeries. This project aims to develop a new generation of \"smart\" hip implants equipped with tiny sensors that monitor the forces acting on the implant during daily activities such as walking or running. These sensors, which generate their own power from movement, will send data wirelessly to doctors, allowing for early detection of potential problems like loosening or wear before they become serious. In addition to advancing implant technology, this project will include educational activities to inspire the next generation of engineers and scientists. Students will gain hands-on experience in designing and testing biomedical devices, while outreach programs will engage K-12 students and educators, promoting awareness of biomedical innovation and STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER proposal addresses the critical need for real-time monitoring of load dynamics in hip implants by integrating energy-harvesting load sensors and wireless communication systems. The project will optimize triboelectric and piezoelectric energy harvesting mechanisms to ensure the sensors generate sufficient power for continuous operation. These sensors will be embedded in the implant to measure load vectors (magnitude and direction), providing precise data for detecting wear, instability, and dislocation. Advanced computational modeling will simulate the mechanical behavior of the implant under varied loading conditions, while experimental validation using a Hip Joint Simulator will ensure compliance with ISO and FDA/ASTM standards. The collected data will fuel the development of machine learning algorithms capable of tailoring diagnostic insights to individual patients. The project includes interdisciplinary curriculum modules, research opportunities for undergraduates, and outreach initiatives to promote STEM education. By combining technical innovation with impactful education, this work aims to set a new standard for orthopedic implants while fostering an expanded science and engineering workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
