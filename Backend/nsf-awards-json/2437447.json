 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of designated institutions of higher education.  Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities for their students to pursue challenging and rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that are significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education.  Sustainability of capacity gains is significantly enhanced by supporting, retaining, and growing the talent of credentialed STEM faculty, and strengthening the grant management capacity of the TCUP institutions.  This project aligns directly with that goal.\r\n\r\nUnited Tribes Technical College has established a STEM-focused Hub to support the growth of educational programs and research within TCUP-eligible institutions of higher education.  The Hub collectively engages STEM faculty, researchers, and other professionals in activities that strengthen teaching, support development of new academic programs, develop research capacity, and help nurture partnerships with federal agencies and other universities.  The TCUP Hub promotes networking opportunities, facilitates peer mentoring and collaboration, and provides opportunities for professional development and venues to share other resources.  This project expands and strengthens the engagement of administrators, faculty, and staff at TCUP institutions, and thereby expands and strengthens the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
