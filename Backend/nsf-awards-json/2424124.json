 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large neuroscience datasets have been produced that characterize the properties of individual neurons and their connections, and neural activity during behavior. Even with this wealth of data, mechanistic understanding of how function arises from the brain is still extremely limited. How do different brain areas work together to represent the world that is perceived? How are communications among different areas -- which depend on stimuli in the environment and the state of the observer -- implemented by a circuit which is fixed? This project will integrate vast datasets into a set of models which will be probed to address mechanistic questions involving multi-area interactions such as these.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, a set of models which are similar in nature will be constructed. This set will start simple, but gradually simplifying assumptions about model parameters will be replaced by optimizations based on dynamical and functional data. The models will be used to test the hypotheses that: 1. The cell-type specific patterns of connectivity between areas are important in determining temporal responses to simple stimuli and observed frequency-specific inter-area interactions. 2. The functional specificity of inter-areal connections is important in determining the responses and inter-area communication in response to complex stimuli. 3. Variations in single-cell properties explain arousal-related changes in visual responses and oscillations. This project combines the unique experimental datasets and expertise of the Allen Institute with the J\u00fclich expertise and resources for large-scale simulation, and the expertise of both partners in data-based neural network modeling. To facilitate further scientific inquiry, the project will construct a set of detailed system-wide models to study how properties of inter-area connectivity influence inter-area interactions, communication, and stimulus representations. Beyond the specific results for the visual system, addressing the mechanisms of inter-area communication is likely important for a mechanistic understanding of cognition.\r\n\r\nA companion project is being funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany (BMBF).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
