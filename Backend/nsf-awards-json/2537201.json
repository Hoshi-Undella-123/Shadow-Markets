 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering is essential to modern society, but the United States faces a critical shortage of engineers. Many students begin to disengage from engineering at an early age, often due to negative experiences with math and a narrow understanding of what engineers do. Research shows that as early as kindergarten, children can develop math anxiety and start to believe that engineering is too challenging or \u201cnot for them.\u201d This mindset is often reinforced by adult attitudes and stereotypes. This exploratory project aims to address this issue by examining how engineering concepts can be introduced to children from pre-kindergarten through fifth grade in positive and age-appropriate ways that encourage their natural curiosity and play. Such early intervention will broaden public understanding of engineering and benefit multiple groups. It will help students see themselves as future engineers, equip educators with effective teaching strategies, and ultimately strengthen the pipeline of talent to meet future workforce demands.\r\n\r\nThe early learner experience is undergoing rapid and profound change. Emerging technologies\u2014such as generative artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014new tools for teaching and practicing engineering, and shifting societal norms around education and technology are reshaping how young children engage with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). These developments are transforming how identity is formed in early childhood classrooms, yet current research has not kept pace with these shifts. At the same time, the United States faces a growing shortage of engineers due to rapid job growth, an aging workforce, and a persistent mismatch between skills and demand. This project addresses these challenges by investigating how PreK\u20135th grade students perceive engineering and how those perceptions form within today\u2019s changing learning environments. Researchers will utilize mixed methods, combining both qualitative and quantitative techniques, to collect data from young students, as well as their parents and educators. They will conduct age-appropriate ethnographic interviews, observations, and surveys to identify the social, emotional, and cognitive factors that influence early STEM identity formation and interest in engineering. A central research question guides the study: What factors shape PreK\u20135 students\u2019 perceptions of engineering, and how do these perceptions intersect with early STEM identity and emerging interest in engineering? Analyzing these factors will help identify key drivers of curiosity and confidence, as well as barriers that may lead to disengagement. Expected outcomes include new empirical insights into early STEM engagement and evidence-based guidance for stakeholders. The project will translate findings into actionable design principles and resources, such as toolkits or frameworks, to inform early education practices. By disseminating a comprehensive report and engaging with education and workforce networks, the project aims to guide future interventions and support strategies for diversifying and expanding the engineering workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
