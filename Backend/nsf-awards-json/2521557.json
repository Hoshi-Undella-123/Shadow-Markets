 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Leveraging VSU\u2019s Leadership Institute to Expand Undergraduate Institutions\u2019 Participation in Geoscience (VSU-LI RISE) project seeks to increase engagement in geosciences among faculty and students at Undergraduate Institutions (UIs). This initiative recognizes the limited representation of UIs in the field and aims to expand opportunities for geoscience education and professional development. Through a planning grant, Virginia State University\u2019s Leadership Institute (LI) will develop structured programming that fosters interest in geoscience careers by incorporating leadership development, research engagement, and faculty mentorship. This project aligns with national efforts to enhance geoscience participation and supports NSF\u2019s mission by fostering scientific progress, advancing national prosperity, and promoting education. The activities will lay the groundwork for a sustainable model that expands opportunities in the geosciences through strategic planning and collaboration.\r\n\r\nThis project will establish a planning framework for the expansion of geoscience education and training through Virginia State University\u2019s Leadership Institute (LI). Over the life of the project, the project team will conduct targeted programming designed to assess and refine approaches that encourage participation in geoscience disciplines. The initiative will focus on three key strategies: (1) integrating geoscience leadership sessions into LI programming, (2) developing K-12 to VSU pipeline pathways that leverage existing geoscience courses, and (3) engaging faculty and students in exploratory research and career development activities that expand their understanding of geoscience opportunities. The planning grant will collect and analyze pilot data from LI conference sessions to assess impact and refine methods for increasing engagement. Findings from this project will inform a full NSF proposal aimed at implementing long-term strategies that enhance geoscience education and career pathways for students and faculty at Undergraduate Institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
