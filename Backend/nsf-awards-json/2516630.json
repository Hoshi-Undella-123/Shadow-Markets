 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will to provide partial support for the 14th US National Combustion Meeting of the Combustion Institute that will be held at Boston, MA on March 16 - 19, 2025. This conference is a gathering of combustion researchers in academia, industry, and government across the United States. It provides a forum for graduate students, postdoctoral students, faculty and other researchers to network and share progress in combustion research. The conference's technical program consists of a series of plenary lectures, contributed oral presentations, and information gathering sessions. Many of the papers will be presented by students, and the meeting is an opportunity for students to network with their peers and faculty from other institutions. A goal of the meeting is to expose students to the latest research and offer opportunity for career development.\r\n\r\nThe conference brings together leading experts to give plenary talks in several areas. Sessions will include the topic areas of Computationally and Data Intensive Research, Detonations and Supersonic Combustion, Diagnostics, Fire Research, Heterogeneous Combustion/Spray and Droplets, IC Engines, Gas Turbines, and Rockets, Laminar Flames, Novel Energy Conversion Techniques, Reaction Kinetics and Fuels, Soot and Nanomaterials, Turbulent Flames. A focus of this conference is an opportunity for graduate students to present and get feedback on their research and thereby enhance their presentation and technical writing skills. The award will support travel grants to non-local students and registration support for local students and mentoring sessions to promote interaction between students and faculty across the US in an informal setting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
