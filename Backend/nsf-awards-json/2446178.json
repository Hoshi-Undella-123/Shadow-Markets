 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a comprehensive, statewide initiative that will build strategic research and development capacity in Louisiana for the conversion of agricultural residues to liquid transportation fuels. The research will identify ways to use electricity for enhancing efficiency in converting low-value byproducts into high-value fuel components. Chemistry, engineering, and data science will guide process improvements through advanced modeling and analysis. An economic analysis will assess the financial viability of these processes, evaluating market potential, cost efficiency, and long-term benefits for farmers and industry stakeholders within Louisiana. Education and workforce development at universities and a partnering community college will target energy technology, and include STEM outreach to K-12 schools. The collaborative project will be led by Louisiana State University (LSU) and the LSU AgCenter. Partner institutions are Louisiana Tech University, River Parishes Community College, Southern University, and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.\r\n\r\nThis project will advance biomass-derived transportation fuels by integrating thermochemical conversion and electrocatalytic upgrading to improve overall efficiencies. Electricity will enhance conversion by transforming liquid and gaseous byproducts into viable fuel sources. Bench-scale experiments will enable rapid testing and data generation. Data-driven modeling, machine learning, and economic analyses will optimize production and assess cost-effectiveness. The initiative will expand Louisiana\u2019s research capacity through faculty hires, research laboratory upgrades, and access to shared research facilities. It will integrate research with workforce training, preparing students and professionals for careers in energy technology and fuel production. Educational programs will provide hands-on training, STEM outreach, and technical instruction to build expertise in bio-electric fuels. Expanding research infrastructure and workforce development will create opportunities for industry collaborations and partnerships. By integrating research, education, and industry engagement, the project will position Louisiana as a leader in bio-electric fuel technology. This project is supported by the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: EPSCoR Research Incubators for STEM Excellence (E-RISE). E-RISE supports the development of sustainable research infrastructure and capacity in EPSCoR jurisdictions through collaborative, hypothesis-driven, or problem-driven research and workforce development to improve competitiveness in selected STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
