 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2025 ACM SIGCOMM Conference will be held in Coimbra, Portugal on September 8 - 11, 2025. This will be the 39th edition of the conference series.  Each year, the conference attracts hundreds of submissions, with acceptance rates typically in the ranging of 10-20%, underscoring its reputation as one of the most competitive venues in the field. The program committee, composed of leading experts from academia and industry, ensures that only the most significant and impactful works are presented. \r\n\r\nThis project supports students from US universities to attend 2025 ACM SIGCOMM in person. Students will have the opportunity to present their work and be exposed to state-of-the-art developments in the field. They will also have the opportunity to interact with peers from institutions worldwide, meet with senior researchers, and participate in discussions that are likely to shape the future of the field. This grant will target graduate students who will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited travel funds. Priority will be given to first-time attendees.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
