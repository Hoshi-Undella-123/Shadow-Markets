 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a novel integrated system to improve survival rates and long-term outcomes in patients experiencing cardiac arrest.  Cardiac arrest remains one of the leading causes of death globally, with survival rates remaining low despite timely intervention. In the US each year over 600,000 patients require CPR, with poor outcomes a major unmet medical need.  By integrating multiple enhancements to automated Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) devices including external defibrillation, this novel system aims to optimize the return of spontaneous circulation and neurological measures and improve survival rates and long-term patient outcomes. This new platform in resuscitation equipment is anticipated to restore circulation and establish a new standard-of-care to improve public health and survival rates. The commercial impact is a strengthened continuum of life-saving interventions from the field to the hospital with a leading innovation to emergency medical technologies.  \r\n \r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to advance a fully automated CPR system for improving blood flow and provide enhanced electrical countershock performance as needed. This project addresses a major critical challenge with mechanical CPR devices which have not demonstrated significant superiority over manual CPR, a minimally effective standard of care. The proposed system combines precision-controlled chest compressions, optimized electrical countershock, and real-time physiological feedback to dynamically adjust treatment to restore circulation and provide defibrillation as needed. The technology development activities will expand on the company\u2019s Phase one award and successful early-stage prototype for a novel automated chest compression system.  The proposed Phase II activities will further product technology development, including biomonitoring and external defibrillation integration, conduct safety testing, complete interface development and provide preclinical validation in an animal model. The project will prepare the product in accordance with medical device standards and requirements for eventual clinical trials and approval.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
