 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2025 Conference on Statistics in Genomics and Genetics (STATGEN 2025) will be held at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, MN from May 21 to May 23, 2025. The conference will bring together researchers, including students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career scientists, to share ideas and collaborate in the rapidly evolving fields of genetics and data science. This event is an invaluable opportunity for early-career researchers to connect with experts, build professional networks, and gain insight from cutting-edge scientific work. By supporting the participation of students and early career researchers, the conference will help cultivate the next generation of scientists who will contribute to advancing knowledge and innovations in this important area of research.\r\n\r\nBuilding on the success of the inaugural meeting, the conference will expose attendees to cutting-edge research and methods in genomics, statistics, and data science. This event will contribute to ongoing dialogue and innovation in genetics and genomics and the integration of statistical methods into genomic research, supporting the development of future breakthroughs in areas such as personalized medicine and disease prevention.  Special emphasis will be placed on fostering the collaboration and participation of early-career researchers, with travel assistance provided by the NSF grant. By facilitating broad participation, the conference will help shape the next generation of researchers and leaders in the field of genomics and data science.  The conference will feature a variety of presentations, including keynotes, panels, invited, contributed, speed, and poster sessions, offering attendees the platform to explore the latest research and discoveries.  Attendees will discuss and promote the latest advancements in statistical theory, methods, and tools, particularly in genetics and genomics, aimed at making evidence-based statistical inferences from complex, noisy, and high dimensional data sources.  More information may be found athttps://www.sph.umn.edu/events-calendar/statgen-2025.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
