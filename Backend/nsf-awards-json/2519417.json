 "awd_abstract_narration": "In today\u2019s rapidly evolving information technology landscape, network security is a critical pillar of cybersecurity. Preparing the next generation of IT research professionals to secure digital infrastructure requires theoretical knowledge, but also demands hands-on experience with real-world threats and data. This project bridges this gap through integration of advanced data science techniques and practical skills in cyberinfrastructure (CI) within the classroom. This project establishes the Cybersecurity Community Hub (C2Hub)\u2014a platform for developing, delivering, and disseminating CI-enabled cybersecurity education and training resources. \r\n\r\nThe project incorporates modular, open-source course materials for both undergraduate and graduate levels, including software tools, real-world datasets, and auto-graded assignments in the C2Hub platform. These modules are designed for seamless execution on NSF-funded CI platforms such as the National Research Platform and Expanse, making it easier for educators to incorporate hands-on CI use into their curricula. To support adoption and community building, the project offers educator workshops to provide training, gather feedback, and cultivate a network of educators sharing resources and best practices. The course materials and community practices developed through this project can serve as a national model for integrating CI into cybersecurity and STEM education. C2Hub promotes a data-driven approach to teaching and learning and expands the nation\u2019s cybersecurity research workforce by empowering students from different institutional backgrounds to engage in cutting-edge data science and cybersecurity training.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
