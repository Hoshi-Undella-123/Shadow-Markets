 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of undergraduate students enrolled at HBCUs so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of this project at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) is to provide high quality educational experiences for students from all backgrounds by infusing high impact undergraduate research projects in organic synthesis and green chemistry into the chemistry curriculum. \r\n\r\nUndergraduate research is identified as a high impact teaching practice and the quality of the undergraduate education experience is vital to the career development of students. By incorporating research endeavors into the curriculum students will develop essential skills thereby increasing their competitiveness for opportunities in the STEM workforce. This project aims to accomplish this goal by 1) infusing genuine organic synthesis research into Organic Chemistry laboratory I and II courses; 2) introducing Green Chemistry and sustainability into Organic Chemistry curriculum; 3) incorporating modern laboratory research equipment for teaching and research toward preparing students for modern instrumentation utilized in current scientific research and industry; and 4) implementing the Peer Mentoring Program (PMP) to engage undergraduate students in innovative undergraduate research. It is anticipated that this TIP project will advance knowledge relative to the infusion of original research into Organic Chemistry and the implementation of Peer-Mentoring-Program (PMP).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
