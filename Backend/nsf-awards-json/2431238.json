 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will upgrade an aging X-ray diffractometer at the University of Georgia (UGA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a key method used to identify minerals, especially in materials that are too small to see with the naked eye. The UGA Department of Geology has operated an XRD facility for many years. The departments of Chemistry, Pharmacy, Food Sciences, Marine Sciences, Engineering, and others also use this resource. The facility assists the local community by identifying minerals and solving industrial problems. These uses align with the goal of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support science, health, and well-being.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade will enhance the Bruker D8 diffractometer, which was first purchased in 2010 with funds from NSF. This instrument has contributed to over 100 research papers, two books, and has helped in the training and education of more than 500 students. The upgrade will allow the XRD facility to continue supporting research and student training. Several projects will use the upgraded diffractometer, covering Critical Minerals, Energy Generation, Environmental Stewardship, Resource Storage, and Geohealth. Some examples of these projects include: 1) Curation of the Allard Economic Geology Collection \u2013 a collection of minerals that\u2019s part of one of the largest natural history collections in the U.S. 2) Critical Zone Science studies \u2013 which look at erosion caused by human activities and how microbes affect soil, from the treetops to the bedrock. 3) Research on PFAS (Forever Chemicals) \u2013 studying how these chemicals behave underground and interact with soil minerals. 4) Critical Minerals studies \u2013 focusing on materials essential for energy technologies that might be in danger of supply shortages. XRD is crucial for identifying these minerals, especially in the Southeastern U.S., where some clay mine wastes contain rare earth elements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
