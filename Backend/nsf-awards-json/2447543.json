 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU Site: Materials for Energy Transition  will engage ten undergraduate students each year for a summer research program. REU students will work in university research groups which bridge chemistry and engineering to improve materials used for the transition from fossil fuels to alternative fuel sources and carbon capture from burning fossil fuels. These materials include wind turbine blades, solar cells, supercapacitors, concentrated solar power plants, and batteries, among other projects. Undergraduates will be recruited primarily from institutions with little or no research opportunities who may be engineering, chemistry and biochemistry, and physics majors interested in research with materials for energy transition. Professional development activities include a focus on communication skills, research ethics, career guidance, and engagements with industry. \r\n\r\nExperienced faculty mentors will guide students to develop research skills and independence. Projects include materials for energy storage and production, energy-efficient material production, and storage of energy waste products. Professional development meetings will cover responsible conduct of research, technical presentation skills, and habits of mind. Weekly field trips will introduce students to local energy- related companies and technologies. To better understand the factors influencing students\u2019 decisions to attend graduate school, the project will correlate occupational and lifestyle values, career path confidence, skill development, science & engineering self-efficacy, and career path. Through this research experience, REU participants will develop confidence and skills to pursue graduate studies and potential careers in the energy and engineering sectors.\r\n\r\nThis Site is supported in part by funds provided to the National Science Foundation by the Semiconductor Research Corporation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
