 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecotron facilities, crucial for studying ecosystem responses to urban change under controlled conditions, suffer from fragmented data practices. Varying data formats, metadata standards, and access protocols hinder data sharing and comparative analysis across institutions. This project addresses these challenges by developing  a unified national cyberinfrastructure specifically designed for ecotron-generated data. \r\n\r\nThe Collaborative Open Framework for Accessible Interoperable Research (CO-FAIR) project establishes a collaborative network of ecotron facilities. The project focuses on developing standardized metadata schemata, common ontologies by leveraging and extending existing standards, and robust data access protocols, adhering to principles that make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). The technical architecture includes a centralized metadata discovery portal, distributed data storage solutions, and Application Programming Interfaces to enable seamless data integration and analysis. Data ingestion pipelines will automate data flow from participating ecotrons, with the University of Idaho's Deep Soil Ecotron serving as a primary development and pilot implementation site. The system is built on open-source technologies to ensure scalability and portability. By standardizing data management and fostering collaboration, CO-FAIR enhances the value and utility of ecotron research. This project will transform disparate ecotron datasets into a cohesive, accessible national resource, accelerating discoveries in soil science, ecosystem ecology, and sustainable agriculture. It will enable large-scale comparative studies, enhance the reproducibility of ecological research, expand access to valuable experimental data, and serve as a model for open science practices in other scientific domains.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
