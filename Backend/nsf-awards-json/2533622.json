 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the \"Conference: Advances and Connections of Modern Geometric Function Theory\", which will be held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, October 25-26, 2025. Geometric function theory is a core subfield of mathematical analysis, and it has deep applications in many scientific fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, material science, and computer science. This conference will feature presentations from both leading experts and rising stars in the field and is designed to enhance the education of as well as foster collaboration among the participants. This will contribute to the training of the next generation of mathematicians and also help enhance the pre-eminent position of the US at the forefront of geometric function theory. In addition to plenary talks, the program includes short talks, a poster session, and an open problem session. The wide and varied array of conference participants will allow for exceptional exchanges of ideas between early-career and more established mathematicians.  More information can be found on the conference website https://lsa.umich.edu/math/seminars/conference-on-advances-and-connections-of-modern-geometric-funct.html.\r\n \r\n\r\nOver the last few decades, the impact of geometric function theory is now seen in many fields including analysis on metric spaces, mappings of finite distortion, conformal geometry, nonlinear PDE, and geometric group theory. The presentations will focus on practical applications of techniques originated in geometric function theory. The mathematics discussed will address challenges within the related fields mentioned above, as well as the reciprocal influence of these areas on geometric function theory. This collaborative spirit aims to foster deeper exploration and innovation within the mathematical community to advance research in modern geometric function theory and related areas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
