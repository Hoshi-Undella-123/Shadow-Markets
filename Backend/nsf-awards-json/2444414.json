 "awd_abstract_narration": "This integrated research-education program will engage 18 high school and middle school science teachers over 3 years in authentic microbiology research to understand how bacteria adaptively evolve when producing biofilm, and how biofilm helps bacteria to resist predation by amoebae. This research training will prepare the teachers to lead these experiments in their classrooms, where students will observe and study bacteria evolving in biofilms over a week using our innovative curriculum. Both research and teaching will be supported by mentors in our laboratory and in their classrooms. We will measure whether our program improves teacher confidence in using life science experiments in their classrooms, as well as student attitudes and self-efficacy towards science topics relevant to future careers in biotechnology. This program will empower greater understanding by teachers and students of how microbes evolve, a crucial topic today.\r\n\r\nThe dynamics of microbial biofilm adaptation, particularly its rapid pace and extent of diversification, present both a scientific puzzle and an educational opportunity. Through training the teachers, our program enables their students (age 12+) to observe evolutionary adaptation in just one week using a safe non-pathogenic Pseudomonas model. Through genome sequencing, we can identify mutations causing distinct colony morphologies. Student and teacher research revealed that biofilm adaptations protect against predation by Dictyostelium discoideum, uncovering an important but overlooked survival benefit. Building on 20 years of biofilm evolution research, our program creates a community where teachers are mentored by researchers with varied skills and by BIORETS alumni. Teachers integrate their research questions into an established curriculum that has engaged over 5,000 students across 19 states. With support from our research team, district coordinators, and community partners, teachers develop confidence in teaching experimental methods and data analysis. This empowers their students to overcome misconceptions in evolution and genetics through active learning, and provides authentic laboratory experiences for today\u2019s careers in biotechnology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
