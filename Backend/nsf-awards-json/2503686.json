 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Georgia Institute of Technology to enable research and educational infrastructure innovations in biophotonics and advanced microscopy. The research goal is to develop and implement parallel multifocal scanning microscopy (PMS), a super-resolution imaging technique for cells and tissues that involves minimal instrument complexity. PMS utilizes specimen movement, allowing multicolor, real-time, volumetric super-resolution microscopy through a standard epi-fluorescence platform. The project will develop the PMS platform (Aim 1), demonstrate its super-resolution imaging capabilities (Aim 2), and showcase its potential applications in pathology and in vivo cell biology (Aim 3). This technique will provide a timely and accessible infrastructure breakthrough for a wide range of cell biological research, fostering new insights into cell physiology and pathology. The project aims to advance imaging science and technology, transform cross-disciplinary research and education infrastructure, and increase participation from scientific communities and underrepresented groups in STEM. Success will establish and strengthen a leading biophotonics research and education infrastructure at the emerging intersection of imaging innovation and life sciences. These efforts will also impact the training of future imaging engineers and professionals, encouraging collaboration across diverse disciplines.\r\n \r\nThe project will develop PMS technology for cell biological research. The innovation is driven by new microscopy concepts, engineering design, and system integration to enhance resolution without causing instrumental complexity. PMS will deliver sub-diffraction-limited resolution, confocal-like optical sectioning, and enhanced contrast in various cell and tissue samples, with minimal photodamage, making it ideal for subcellular and volumetric tissue studies. This approach will revolutionize existing microscopy platforms, including epifluorescence, scanning-based, and super-resolution microscopy. By advancing technology development and expanding infrastructural dissemination, this project aims to foster innovation in optical microscopy and enable new conceptual and methodological breakthroughs in both basic and translational biological research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
