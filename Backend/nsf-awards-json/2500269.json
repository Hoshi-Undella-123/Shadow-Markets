 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) EPSCoR Graduate Fellowship Program (EGFP) supports EGFP designated institutions and programs in EPSCoR jurisdictions by providing funding for graduate fellowships for new or continuing EGFP-eligible applicants. EGFP awards provide funding for a total of three years of stipend and an associated cost-of-education (COE) allowance for each NSF EPSCoR Graduate Fellow. \r\n\r\nThis award at the University of Iowa will support eight EPSCoR Graduate Fellows whose research will align with the unique goals and programs supported by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), and Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP). The project aims to enhance Iowa\u2019s and the nation\u2019s manufacturing capacity by training graduate students to become future industry and academic leaders in advanced manufacturing. The project leverages recent advancements in AI, sensing, and robotics technologies to transform manufacturing systems into data-rich smart and connected systems. It aligns with Iowa\u2019s Manufacturing 4.0 strategy and aims to boost the global competitiveness of Iowa's manufacturing sector. \r\n\r\nThe project will focus on four key areas: Advanced Manufacturing Processes, Sensing and Robotics, Data Integration for Smart Manufacturing Systems, and Biomanufacturing and Biotechnology. Researchers at the University of Iowa\u2019s College of Engineering will utilize additive manufacturing, laser materials processing, photonics/optical sensors, motion planning and control, data fusion, and transfer learning to develop next-generation manufacturing systems. The expected outcomes include the development of AI-enabled, data-driven technologies that reduce costs, boost productivity and innovation, shorten time to market, and improve the quality and scalability of complex manufacturing systems. The project will involve collaboration between various departments in the College of Engineering at the University of Iowa. The educational outcomes will focus on providing high-quality personalized graduate experiences, developing interdisciplinary technical skills and leadership abilities through an interdisciplinary curriculum, hands-on research experiences, professional development workshops, and mentorship programs to ensure the Fellows are well-prepared for successful careers in both academia and industry. Additionally, the program will include a structured mentoring and progress assessment plan, onboarding and orientation activities, professional skill development sessions, and engagement activities to foster a sense of community and collaboration. The researchers will integrate advanced technologies and bioscience expertise to drive economic development, train future manufacturing researchers and engineers, and strengthen the national talent pool in advanced manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
