 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern scientific data sets\u2014ranging from single-cell RNA sequencing with tens of thousands of genes per patient, to galaxy-survey spectra with millions of stars, to user-item interaction matrices in online platforms\u2014share two features: (i) ultra-high dimensionality and (ii) latent parameters that obey common structural laws (e.g., exchangeability, sparsity, or low-rank dependence). This project tackles both challenges at once. It advances statistical foundations for such problems by (1) providing a new framework to theoretically study empirical Bayes methods in these complex models that learn the latent-parameter distribution directly from the data, and (2) developing cutting-edge unsupervised dimension-reduction techniques that embed the high-dimensional observations into lower-dimensional representations while preserving the essential structure and relationships within the data. Together, these tools will transform ad-hoc prior modeling into an objective, data-driven procedure and yield principled, scalable inference for large-scale applications. Further, collaborations with astronomers will ensure immediate scientific impact, and several of the research directions will shape the Ph.D. dissertation of multiple Columbia graduate students, fostering the next generation of data-science leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project integrates two tightly linked research thrusts. (a) Building on recent advances in nonparametric empirical Bayes, the PI will design flexible empirical Bayes estimators for latent-variable distributions for exchangeable parameters. The central innovation is to merge empirical Bayes ideas with variational approximations in general probabilistic latent-variable models, producing estimators that remain computationally tractable, and achieve optimal risk. (b) Classical linear dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis and multidimensional scaling are often inadequate for datasets that are growing increasingly complex in fields such as genomics, astronomy, and finance. To tackle these challenges, the PI will design non-linear reduction techniques --- combining manifold learning with low-rank factor models ---informed by ideas from optimal transport and algebraic geometry. Together, these advances will deepen statistical theory at the nexus of empirical Bayes, unsupervised learning, and high-dimensional inference. All algorithms will be released as open-source R/Python packages accompanied by tutorials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
