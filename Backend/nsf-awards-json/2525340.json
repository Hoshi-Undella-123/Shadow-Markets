 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reverse weathering is a chemical process that forms clay minerals from dissolved silica and positively charged ions in marine sediments. This process is important because it impacts ocean pH, the availability of important metals (e.g. iron, lithium), and the long-term carbon cycle. In this project, the researchers plan to use stable and radioactive silicon isotopes to track reverse weathering processes in sediments of the Mississippi River Plume. The research includes laboratory and ship-based experiments exploring the role of microbial activity in sediment silicon cycling and reverse weathering. The experiments will also study how the presence or absence of oxygen and different sediment types influence these processes. The project will produce novel data and key insights about the cycling of silicon in marine sediments. Education and outreach activities focus on training the next generation of scientists at multiple levels. These include experiential learning activities for college undergraduates and training for a graduate student. This project will also provide two opportunities for high school students: 1) support scholarships for students to take an immersive six-week marine science class offered at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab and 2) provide support for high school students in rural Missouri to visit the Mobile Bay ecosystem where they will be introduced to marine science. \r\n\r\nReverse weathering (RW) reactions are the collection of early diagenetic processes which produce authigenic clay in marine sediments. Reverse weathering is important because it releases CO2 and is thought to be a quantitatively important sink in the geochemical cycle of multiple elements in the marine environment (e.g. Si, Fe, K, Mg). Until recently, RW has been considered a geochemical process, but new work has indicated the potential importance of microbes in the RW process. In this project, the research team will use a combination of laboratory and field experiments to quantify the signature of microbial activity on silicon isotopic composition in surface sediments in a subtropical deltaic environment (the Mississippi River Plume). Specifically, the research team seeks to address three key knowledge gaps associated with these processes: the roles of seasonality, redox state, and sediment characteristics. This research uses a powerful combination of radioisotope 32Si and \u03b430Si tracer approaches to test hypotheses that aim to understand sediment processes in the field. In addition to providing new information and novel data, this project includes activities focused on training the next generation of scientists through experiential learning opportunities for high school students, research experiences for undergraduates, and training for a graduate student. Beyond the science objectives, the project will also contribute to redeveloping US domestic infrastructure for analysis of silicon stable isotopes in oceanographic systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
