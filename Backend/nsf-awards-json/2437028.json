 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support research aimed at advancing our understanding of quantum materials, a class of materials that exhibit unique behaviors due to their underlying quantum properties. These materials can conduct electricity without loss (superconductivity) or have exceptional sensing abilities, making them crucial for next-generation technologies like quantum computing, information storage, and high-efficiency power systems. For example, high-temperature superconductors could enable revolutionary applications such as controllable nuclear fusion, levitating vehicles, and more efficient power grids. Therefore, this research aims to develop new models and methods for designing quantum materials by linking macroscopic continuum theory with quantum field, electric field, and magnetic field interactions. By integrating these approaches, the research will provide fresh perspectives on improving properties like superconductivity and creating new materials for energy harvesting, sensing, and actuators. The work will also play a significant role in maintaining the U.S. leadership in technological innovation. Additionally, this project will encourage broader participation in research by involving students in quantum materials studies and promoting interdisciplinary education in mechanics of materials and quantum engineering.\r\n\r\nA theoretical and computational modeling approach will be established to study and design quantum materials. Specifically, the approach will link continuum mechanics concepts with a suitable quantum mechanical-based order parameter to enable a fresh perspective on quantum engineering. The work will explore the modeling of several distinct aspects of quantum materials: (i) Impact of strain and/or strain gradient, anisotropy, and flexoelectricity in quantum superconductors to provide a new direction in terms of improving the critical temperature and current, (ii) A three-way coupling between quantum field, electric field, and magnetic field in nanostructures, mediated by strain and/or strain-gradient leading to a novel class of quantum materials for sensing and energy harvesting, and (iii) The production of mechanical deformation through alteration in the quantum field (e.g., by laser or change in quantum confinement) leading to a novel class of quantum actuators.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
