 "awd_abstract_narration": "As population growth and urbanization accelerate worldwide, the demand for infrastructure that is both resilient and resource-efficient is becoming increasingly urgent. Concrete, the most widely used human-made material on Earth, plays a central role in meeting this demand but faces escalating challenges related to aging when exposed to the elements, material scarcity, and the limitations of current construction methods. This United States/Saudi Arabia workshop brings together leading researchers from both nations to identify transformative solutions for next-generation concrete materials and systems. Both the United States (US) and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) are leaders in research and technology transfer related to advanced cementitious materials. However, both countries face important challenges linked to the availability of quality materials, aging infrastructure, and the growing frequency and severity of extreme natural events. By fostering international collaboration and integrating expertise across materials science, construction engineering, and structural engineering, the workshop advances the national interest by promoting scientific progress and laying the foundation for innovative infrastructure that enhances public welfare, defense readiness, and economic resilience. A particular focus on mentoring early-career researchers and building global research networks supports the development of a skilled, internationally engaged STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the workshop will bring approximately 20 US researchers to Riyadh to collaborate with counterparts from the KSA in four key research areas: (1) resource-efficient construction, (2) durability and resilience, (3) innovative materials and construction methods, and (4) next-generation cementitious binders and mixture design. The role of artificial intelligence, automation, and machine learning in accelerating innovation will be integrated into each focal area. The workshop will identify critical knowledge gaps and catalyze new directions in cementitious materials research, advancing a platform for interdisciplinary collaboration. Outcomes will include a joint research agenda, a publicly available workshop report, and a digital platform to support ongoing collaboration and proposal development aligned with the priorities of NSF and KSA\u2019s Research, Development, and Innovation Authority.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
