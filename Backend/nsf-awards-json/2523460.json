 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support student travel to the ACM Hypertext Conference (ACM HT) pre-conference summer school, to be held in September 2025.  ACM HT is a leading venue for high quality peer-reviewed research on hypertext theory, systems, applications, publishing, artwork, and related practices. The summer school program is designed to connect senior researchers with up and coming students through interactive group sessions and one-on-one research and career mentoring activities.  Bringing young researchers from a variety of disciplines to the summer school program will both help them develop their own research and careers and benefit the hypertext research field as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis grant will provide travel support to about 10 U.S.-based students who otherwise have limited travel funding and so might not be able to attend.  The committee will widely advertise the availability of travel funding to solicit applications from students of a range of institutional, disciplinary, topical, and personal backgrounds.  Criteria for selection include fit to the conference topics, ability to both benefit from and provide value to the summer school, and financial need.  Students' institutions will also be encouraged to provide matching funds to increase the impact of the award and support more students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
