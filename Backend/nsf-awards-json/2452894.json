 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many closed physical systems are modeled mathematically by self-adjoint differential operators.  Analysis of the spectrum is of central importance in understanding the long-term behavior of such systems. In some examples, the spectrum can be interpreted of as the color of light, or the energy range at which a semi-conductor allows electron travel. To obtain differential operators that are self-adjoint, boundary conditions must usually be imposed; think of a vibrating string that is clamped down or otherwise restricted at both ends, or a vibrating drum. In many examples, we know the complete spectrum of an operator with one set of boundary conditions, while the physical behavior of the same system with other boundary conditions is hard or impossible to compute directly. Perturbation theory will be developed to allow access to the spectral information to a wide class of operators under changing boundary conditions, even though this behavior is often quite unstable. The project will provide research opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and engage the PI in conference organization; outcomes of the project will be disseminated widely through research articles and conference presentations.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the two parts of this project\u2019s intellectual merit are trace class perturbations of self-adjoint operators on Hilbert space, and Aleksandrov-Clark theory on the polydisk. The first part concerns the singular spectrum under infinite rank perturbations such as trace class perturbations and beyond. Of particular interest is the development of an Aronszajn-Donoghue-type theory. The proposed methods fall within function theoretic operator theory, but touch to varying degrees harmonic analysis, measure and spectral theory, as well as abstract perturbation theory. In the second part, although Aleksandrov-Clark theory on the polydisk was established \u2018only\u2019 in 2020, it has become evident that it harbors a rich theory and is rather distinct from the one-variable setting. To date, investigations for the polydisk are lacking the connection with unitary perturbations, and therefore also to spectral theory and applications. Seeking remedy and providing a systematic study of the field are the main goals. Inspiration is drawn from classical Aleksandrov-Clark theory, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and analytic function theory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
