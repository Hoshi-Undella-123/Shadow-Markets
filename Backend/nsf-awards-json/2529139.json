 "awd_abstract_narration": "Butterflies are one of the most familiar and charismatic groups of insects. They are important in natural ecosystems as herbivores, pollinators, and components of food webs. In temperate regions, like North America, butterflies are well-studied and often used as indicators for how biodiversity changes across space and time, and as flagship species for conservation. In the tropics, however, where butterfly diversity is far greater, there is an urgent need for basic information about species diversity, distribution, natural history, and trends in abundance over time. This project will focus on the butterflies of protected areas in Ecuador, which is one of the world's three most diverse countries for butterflies. The project will document butterflies using observations from nature along with DNA, to help us better understand butterfly diversity and insect communities in the tropics. The project will provide educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students through independent research projects, courses in insect biodiversity, and training experiences in Ecuador. Live-stream events, a museum exhibit and school visits through the Scientist in Every Florida School program will help communicate the project to school children and the public.\r\n\r\nThe project will initiate a multi-year survey of butterflies within national and local protected areas in Ecuador. This will build unique spatial, temporal, DNA sequence and functional trait datasets, and fill major gaps in knowledge of the distribution and diversity of Ecuador\u2019s c. 4500 butterfly species, almost a quarter of the world's fauna. The project will conduct regular butterfly monitoring events throughout the year at a dozen sites in different biogeographic regions, environments, and elevations, where park rangers will receive equipment and training in field methods and science communication. The project team will also partner with park rangers to undertake expeditions to collect and study butterflies in remote, poorly explored mountain ranges and forests. Specimen collections and DNA 'barcodes' will facilitate systematic research and descriptions of new butterfly species. Functional trait data will be used to examine how environmental filtering and competition influence seasonal variation in butterflies, and how evolutionary and ecological processes influence spatial patterns of diversity. The project will train university students in the USA, reach school children and the public through museum programs, collaborate with scientists and naturalists in Ecuador, and build interest in biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
