 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the capability to store and preserve biomolecules at room temperature, eliminating the need for energy-intensive cold storage. Current methods for preserving biological materials rely heavily on refrigeration and freezing, requiring substantial energy consumption and complex cold-chain logistics that limit access to biotechnology. This innovation may democratize access to biotechnology research by reducing storage costs and simplifying transport. The technology could benefit medical research, diagnostics, and personalized medicine by enabling more efficient preservation of biological samples. Additionally, this advancement would help reduce energy consumption and associated costs from cold storage, while also enhancing the security and longevity of stored biomolecules for both research and clinical applications.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop and optimize a novel synthetic polymer-based technology for encapsulating biomolecules that enables ambient temperature storage. The research will focus on developing automated, scalable processes for efficient sample preservation. Key technical objectives include optimizing the polymer chemistry, establishing robust encapsulation methods, and validating the technology through comprehensive stability testing. The project will evaluate the technology's effectiveness in preserving both synthetic and natural biomolecules under various environmental conditions, with particular attention to maintaining molecular integrity for downstream applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
