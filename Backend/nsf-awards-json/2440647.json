 "awd_abstract_narration": "The construction industry is poised for a major digital transformation with technological innovations that are set to improve the safety, productivity, and sustainability of the field. To leverage these advanced technologies to their full potential, there is an urgent need for skilled professionals who understand both construction and digital technology. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to San Diego State University (SDSU) in collaboration with the University of Virginia (UVA) will develop a comprehensive graduate program in smart construction technologies. The project anticipates training of one hundred and thirty\u2010five (135) MS students, including thirty-one (31) funded trainees, from fields such as civil engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science. By bridging the gap between traditional construction practices and emerging digital innovations, the program will help create safer worksites, better-performing buildings, and more sustainable infrastructure while opening construction careers to more groups of professionals.\r\n\r\nThe SCIBER-CT (pronounced \u201ccyber city\u201d) NRT program will integrate three technological focus areas within modern construction practices: artificial intelligence and machine learning, robotics and automation, and advanced communications and immersive technologies. The educational framework includes an 18-unit certificate program featuring specialized coursework, research components, and internships, with plans to develop a full master\u2019s degree following a feasibility study. Students will participate in professional development modules covering essential skills like communication, team science, and ethics. Experiential learning through industry internships and hackathons will allow students to apply their technical knowledge to real-world construction challenges. These elements are designed to cultivate T-shaped professionals who not only excel in their areas of specialization but are also skilled in cross-disciplinary collaboration. The cross-institutional collaboration leverages SDSU expertise in advanced construction technology and UVA\u2019s established experience with interdisciplinary graduate education in cyber-physical systems. This partnership creates a model for expanding advanced graduate education opportunities while addressing critical workforce needs. The promise of the SCIBER-CT program is to transform graduate training in construction by creating a scalable, industry-relevant educational ecosystem that advances both scientific knowledge and societal benefits.\r\n\r\nThe NRT Institutional Partnership Pilot (NRT-IPP) is a collaborative effort between the Directorates for STEM Education (EDU) and Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships (TIP) to support research and education projects with high industry relevance in emerging fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
