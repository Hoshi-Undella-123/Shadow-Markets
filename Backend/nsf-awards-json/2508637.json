 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of undergraduate students enrolled at HBCUs so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. This project contributes to HBCU-UP program goals by redesigning foundational mathematics coursework at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff to integrate essential programming and data analytics skills using modern cloud-based platforms and evidence-based peer learning strategies. By enhancing student engagement and providing faculty with targeted professional development, the project advances national priorities and supports STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis project\u2019s curricular innovation combines hands-on coding, data analysis, and structured peer mentorship to improve student learning and retention. Faculty are equipped with updated tools and pedagogical training to effectively deliver the revised course. The project creates a repository of open-access instructional materials designed for wide adoption across institutions. Rigorous evaluation and iterative improvement approaches ensure sustainability and scalability, contributing knowledge on effective STEM education practices that prepare students for data-driven careers in science and technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
