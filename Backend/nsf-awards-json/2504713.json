 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solar flares are transient, yet dramatic energy release events in the Sun\u2019s atmosphere that, together with the closely associated phenomenon of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), form a fundamental part of geo-effective space weather. Since their first discovery in 1859, substantial efforts have been made in understanding the energetics of flares. However there remains outstanding questions concerning the ways in which energy is released and transported in flares. We propose a comprehensive project targeted at advancing our understanding of flare energy deposition into the solar chromosphere.\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on spectral lines of orthohelium, which have been shown to exhibit the unusual characteristic of initially dimming in the earliest stages of energy deposition into the lower atmosphere, before then brightening. These dimmings have been shown to be related to the properties of non-thermal particles present in flares. Using a combination of exceptionally high spatial resolution imaging spectroscopy of the He I 10830 \u00c5 and D3 5876 \u00c5 lines (via the 1.6m BBSO/GST) and state-of-the-art radiation hydrodynamic modelling (RADYN and RH codes) we will: 1) Take new observations using GST and perform analysis of the spatial and spectral characteristics of flare emission and enhanced absorption of the He I 10830 \u00c5 and D3 5876 \u00c5, both individually and in relation to each other; and 2) Determine if our models are consistent with those observations, in terms of contrast level, the temporal behavior and spectral properties, and hence infer the physical conditions that produce the helium spectra. The team comprises both ground-based and space-based observational experts, and modelling experts, allowing us to complement the BBSO/GST observations with IRIS and SDO data and forward modelling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
