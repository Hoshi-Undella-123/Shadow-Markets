 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sodium metal anode-based battery chemistry is a promising candidate for next generation energy storage systems due to its high energy density, natural abundance, and low cost. These advantages make it well suited for large-scale or grid-scale applications such as electric grids and transportation. However, the practical use of sodium batteries is hindered by challenges in controlling the battery materials\u2019 decay, which directly affects battery performance attributes such as power, shelf life, and cycle life. This project will develop new materials characterization tools to study the interior of the batteries\u2019 materials under changing conditions similar to how it would operate to store and discharge energy. The resulting fundamental knowledge will help enable the rational design of next generation batteries and electrochemical systems. These insights will not only promote the progress of science but also support the development of alternative energy storage technologies beyond lithium-ion, contributing to enhanced national energy security and use of domestic critical materials. Additionally, the project will engage undergraduate and graduate students through hands-on research experiences, while expanding science outreach to K-12 students to promote scientific literacy and awareness of sustainable energy. These efforts will help expand the workforce in science and engineering and help cultivate a skilled workforce to address future energy challenges.\r\n\r\nThis project will advance fundamental understanding of the interfacial solvation structure and dynamics at sodium metal\u2013electrolyte interfaces in sodium-ion batteries, a critical yet underexplored area in battery science. The project will develop and apply advanced characterization techniques that integrate high resolution spectroscopy with electrochemical measurements. These tools will enable direct investigation of both static and dynamic molecular interactions at the metal\u2013electrolyte interface, providing unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Specifically, the project will probe processes such as solid electrolyte interphase formation and ion transport, which are critical to the development of more stable and efficient sodium metal batteries. The insights generated through this work will inform the rational design of electrolytes and interfaces for sodium metal batteries and, more broadly, for emerging energy storage technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
