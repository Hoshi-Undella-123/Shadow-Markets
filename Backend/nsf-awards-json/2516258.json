 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the student attendance at the International Conference on Electron, Ion and Photon Beam Technology and Nanofabrication (EIPBN) to be held May 27-30, 2025, in Savannah, GA. The EIPBN meeting is the premier lithography and nanofabrication symposium in the world and attracts participants from academia, industry, and government laboratories. This forum is instrumental in the generation and incubation of breakthrough and transformative ideas in the critical areas of nanofabrication, semiconductor manufacturing, and quantum computing. EIPBN is a key mechanism for linking basic science with industry stakeholders towards the development of nanotechnology-enabled products, which are critical for the US chip and defense industries. This conference offers a forum for the open exchange of new and previously unpublished scientific research and ideas. This award will support the participation of undergraduate and graduate students and training of domestic workforce for the semiconductor manufacturing industry.\r\n\r\nEIPBN is a major international meeting and will provide a single forum for discussion of the latest developments in lithography, fabrication, imaging, measurement and characterization of nanoscale electronics, devices and structures. The NSF funding will provide travel support to 24 US students so they may participate in the short courses, the commercial session, the technical program, and other career-developing events. There are also a number of student training programs, including a career mentoring session with academic and industry leaders, student breakfast with the organization committee, start-up competition to promote translational research, and the best student presentation awards to highlight student researchers. This award will expand student participation in STEM and strengthen the domestic workforce to fuel economic prosperity, national security, and global competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
