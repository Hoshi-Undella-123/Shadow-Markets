 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award will support US-based participants to attend the 2025 edition of the Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium (GPOTS), to be held at the University of Puerto Rico \u2013 Rio Piedras, May 19-23, 2025.  GPOTS is a major international conference series on operator theory and operator algebras which is widely attended each year by mathematicians at all career stages from around the world. The 2025 edition of the conference will feature both invited and contributed talks on a wide variety of topics in these areas; participants will discuss important new developments and propose problems for future research.  More information about the meeting can be found on the conference website http://math.uprrp.edu/gpots-2025\r\n \r\nGPOTS focuses on recent developments in operator algebras and operator theory, including the structure theory of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, free probability, noncommutative geometry, and the theory of operator spaces.  These areas of mathematics have a distinguished history in the field of analysis, and admit deep applications to many other mathematical fields, such as differential geometry, quantum information theory, dynamical systems, and mathematical physics.  The conference will provide a stimulating environment for collaboration and communication between participants.  Plenary speakers will showcase the latest trends and advancements in the field, and several sessions of contributed talks will offer participants at all career stages the opportunity to promote their own research and network with colleagues.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
