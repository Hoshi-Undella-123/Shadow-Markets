 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a two-week workshop to be held July 20 to 31, 2026 in the Geophysical Sciences Department at the University of Chicago. The workshop is named in honor of Carl-Gustaf Rossby, an early pioneer of atmospheric science and Department Chair at the university. The event is expected to draw a group of 30 to 40 graduate students and early-career scientists who will attend a series of lectures and participate in hackathon-style research projects performed in small groups. As in previous years the workshop is organized and run by graduate students and postdocs at the university with minimal input by Chicago faculty.\r\n\r\nThe theme of this year's Rossbypalooza is earth system predictability across scales, motivated by the need for better predictions of weather phenomena from severe storms to heat waves to long-term shifts in weather patterns.  One issue to be addressed is the subseasonal-to-seasonal predictability gap between about two weeks and a month and another is the representation of scale interactions in forecast models. A third is the recent breakthroughs that have enabled machine learning-based forecast systems to meet or exceed the skill of the best traditional forecast models.\r\n\r\nFunds provided here support travel for 25 participants selected through a competitive process. The award also covers breakfast and lunch for all participants along with travel support for three guest speakers. The topic of the workshop is of both societal and scientific interest given the need for accurate forecasts to protect life and property. The work also has broader impacts through its effort to train the next generation of climate scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
