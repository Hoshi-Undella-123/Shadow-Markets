 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Committee on New Researchers of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics will hold its 25th conference at Vanderbilt University during the three days prior to the Joint Statistical Meeting. The event will include oral and poster presentations by new researchers, plenary talks by established researchers, and open discussions on future directions for statistics, probability, and data science. There will also be panel discussions on teaching and mentoring, publishing, funding, and collaborations.\r\n\r\nThe New Researchers Conference is an annual event organized under the auspices of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics by its Committee on New Researchers. It serves as the flagship meeting for early-career researchers in statistics, probability, and data science. In 2025, Vanderbilt University will host the 25th New Researchers Conference on the three days prior to the Joint Statistical Meetings. The primary objective of the conference is to provide a platform for interaction among new researchers and offer opportunities for mentorship from leaders in the field. This conference is explicitly aimed at developing the next generation of researchers in statistics and probability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
