 "awd_abstract_narration": "Particle physics seeks to describe how the basic building blocks of matter interact to form the world we observe. The particles and forces observed in the last century of experiments are united into a single theory by the Standard Model (SM). In its current form, however, the SM conflicts with measurements of the universe at larger length scales. For example, it does not explain the nature of dark matter observed in galaxies. These disagreements suggest the SM is only part of a larger theory with other particles and forces that have not been discovered yet. The High Energy Physics Group at the University of Notre Dame, as a member of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, is searching for signs of physics beyond the Standard Model in the proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The group's work includes searches for direct evidence of new physics, work on upgrades to the CMS detector, and a strong educational outreach initiative.\r\nAs the LHC finishes its third run of data-taking, the Notre Dame group continues its leading role in physics analyses. The group is involved in multiple searches for exotic behavior in the Higgs sector, searches for supersymmetry, and is pioneering techniques in both effective field theory and data scouting.  The group\u2019s technical contributions are broad, including: electromagnetic calorimeter operations and management of the U.S. contributions; leadership in High Level Trigger monitoring; leadership in the CMS Simulation effort and Data Preservation; research and development for experimental upgrades of the CMS calorimeter and tracking detectors for improved performance at high luminosity; and in Computing, the group holds a U.S. CMS management position related to university-based computing facilities. The centerpiece of the group\u2019s outreach efforts is QuarkNet, now in its twenty-seventh year. Notre Dame is the managing institute for this national program.  QuarkNet currently consists of 54 Centers across the United States and Puerto Rico, and has been expanded to include eleven different experimental programs at seven national and foreign laboratories.  Through QuarkNet, the particle physics field is creating a suite of outreach materials and demonstration projects that bring the excitement of particle physics to the public on several levels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
