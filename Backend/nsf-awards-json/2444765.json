 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site award to Colorado State University\u2019s Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in Fort Collins, CO, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2025-2027. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities will participate in the program. The REU site will train undergraduates in molecular life sciences including biochemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, immunology, and virology. Participants will benefit from training offered by a large pool of experienced scientists from 14 departments with a track record of commitment to mentoring undergraduates. Society will benefit from the development of a cohort of well-trained molecular bioscience student researchers who will go on to strengthen the STEM workforce. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done through student feedback and career outcomes.  Students should apply to the REU site using NSF ETAP (Education and Training Application: https://etap.nsf.gov).\r\n\r\nThe individual research experiences and interactions with mentors provide opportunities for implementing the latest research techniques and technologies within the molecular life sciences. Potential research projects include HIV-1 protease autoprocessing, basic biology of mycobacterial pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, genomic/proteomic investigation of photosynthesis efficiency and regulation, mammalian cell architecture using single-molecule biophysical techniques, AI/ML modeling of metabolic regulation, thermophilic microbe DNA-dependent processes, computer-guided DNA and protein engineering, epigenetic mechanisms involving small non-coding RNA.  The program also provides workshops on science communication (oral, written, poster) and responsible conduct of research (including ethical theory, notebook keeping, mentor/mentee relationships). Additionally career professional development workshops will prepare students to submit graduate school applications and resumes for entry into the workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
