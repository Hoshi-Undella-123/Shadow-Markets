 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will partially support US researchers to attend a five-day conference on July 13-17, 2026, at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, an official satellite event for the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM), July 23-30, 2026, in Philadelphia, PA. The ICM is the most prestigious conference in mathematics and occurs every four years. Because of the location of Rutgers University near Philadelphia, conference participants will have a unique opportunity to interact with international mathematical leaders and rising stars. The conference will bring together distinguished senior speakers and a wide range of junior mathematicians, and will thus help to support, train and encourage the next generation of researchers.\r\n \r\nThe scientific themes of the Rutgers conference include i) complex geometry, ii) gauge theory in dimensions 3 to 8, iii) geometric analysis, geometric flows, and minimal surfaces, iv) low-dimensional topology, knot theory, and Floer homology, and v) symplectic geometry and Gromov-Witten invariants. Each day of the meeting will focus on one of these themes. The conference is expected to generate transfers of knowledge, new collaborations, and a cross-fertilizations of ideas, and further inspire graduate students and junior mathematicians. The conference website is located athttps://tinyurl.com/36hn42by and maintained by Rutgers University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
