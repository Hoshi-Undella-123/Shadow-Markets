 "awd_abstract_narration": "Miami Dade College\u2019s (MDC) Advanced Technologies in Supply Chain Logistics and Education (AT-SCaLE) project will aim to modernize MDC's supply chain education program by integrating advanced technologies such as Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) into the traditional supply chain curriculum. This project will provide students with the knowledge, skills, and hands-on experience required to thrive in a rapidly evolving workforce and support the nation's economic competitiveness and workforce development. Over the three-year project, MDC anticipates that 103 students will be recruited through AT-SCaLE Summer Camps, Lunch & Learn Events, Lab Tours, and Continuing Education opportunities. These efforts will lead to enrollment in credit-bearing courses within the Associate of Science (AS) in Supply Chain program or the Logistics and Transportation Specialist College Credit Certificate (CCC), equipping students with the skills to enter and excel in the supply chain and logistics field. The project will include a range of activities designed to address evolving workforce needs and modernize supply chain education. MDC will obtain state-of-the-art equipment for the AT-SCaLE Lab and partner with Quanser to provide a one-week training program for the Principal Investigators in addition to ongoing technical support. Prologis, a global leader in logistics, will provide Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) who will share insights on advanced technologies and best practices, guide internships and placement opportunities, and meet with MDC students at least once per semester. The project will establish a modernized curriculum with input from an existing Industry Advisory Board, which will offer feedback on new course modules. Flexible learning pathways, including updated weekend courses and stackable credentials will be developed to support incumbent workers seeking to upskill and advance their careers. \r\n\r\nThere is significant potential to advance understanding of modernizing the supply chain workforce and advance knowledge within the field of supply chain and logistics through the enhancement of educational methodologies by incorporating specific advanced technologies and continuous real-time industry feedback into the revised MDC supply chain curriculum. The goal of the project is to address the technician-level workforce needs by incorporating advanced technologies into the existing supply chain curriculum. The project will create a state-of-the art AT-SCaLE Lab to provide hands-on training with industry-standard tools, increase program enrollment and retention; and develop flexible learning pathways for incumbent workers. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
