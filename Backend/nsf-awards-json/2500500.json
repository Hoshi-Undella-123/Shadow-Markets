 "awd_abstract_narration": "A St. Louis bioscience labor market analysis showed within the St. Louis, Missouri region, biosciences account for over 19,000 jobs at over 800 firms, roughly two-thirds of which are in research, testing and medical labs, and biomanufacturing. Bioscience employers in the region project 1400 job openings annually between 2021 and 2031, the majority of which require a high school diploma and short-term training or an associate's degree. As only one biotechnology program currently exists at a community college in the region, there is a clear need for additional programs that can supply the much-needed employees for the biosciences industry. St. Charles Community College proposes to establish a biotechnology program to educate skilled biotechnicians to meet the critical need for highly skilled, entry-level and mid-level biotechnician and biomanufacturing positions in the region.\r\n\r\nThe project objectives are to (1) develop and implement a new Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.) degree in biotechnology with industry-aligned, stackable certificates; (2) prepare students to earn industry-recognized certifications and microcredentials, such as the Biotechnician Assistant Credentialing Exam (BACE) or Bioscience Core Skills Institute (BCSI); (3) establish strong workforce connections in order to create a work-based experiential program that supports retention, degree and certificate completion, industry-recognized certifications, and workforce readiness; and (4) create and implement a robust K-12 high school recruitment program. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
