 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rock deformation is a sub-discipline of Earth science that employs experimental techniques from geology and engineering to measure the strength of rocks. Observations and data from rock deformation are essential to a wide range of research in geoengineering, geologic hazards, geophysics, and planetary geology. However, most institutions do not have active research programs in rock deformation, due to the scale, cost, and technical needs of an experimental rock deformation lab. The Research Opportunities in Rock Deformation (RORD) REU site provides training in experimental rock deformation and generates a robust pipeline of students and industry professionals from all backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThe RORD REU site provides research and mentorship opportunities for undergraduate students in the field of experimental rock deformation. The long-term objective is to expand the pipeline of students pursuing research or industry careers in rock deformation or related fields. Student participants receive training in research methods and professional development topics that provide a stable foundation for graduate school or related career paths. A large team of PIs and senior participants, composed of academic researchers in rock deformation, ensures that students who participate in the program have a deep professional network to support their future endeavors. Students are drawn from the full spectrum of higher education institutions. Strong emphases are placed on recruiting students from smaller colleges and universities that do not have research programs in rock deformation. The REU site includes three integrated sessions: a field session to introduce students to the geological study of deformed rocks, a laboratory session where students conduct experiments on specimens collected during the field session, and a conference session where students have the opportunity to present the results of their research projects. The REU site uses an innovated distributed model, leveraging the combined lab capacity of the PIs and other senior participants to support 10 students per year.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
