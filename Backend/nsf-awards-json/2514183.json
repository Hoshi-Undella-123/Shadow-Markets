 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2025 ASME Summer Heat Transfer Conference (SHTC2025), co-located with the ASME Energy Sustainability Conference, will be held in Westminster, Colorado, from July 8\u201310, 2025. This annual event serves as a major platform for researchers, engineers, and industry professionals to share new ideas about heat and mass transfer, fostering collaboration across technical fields. The conference seeks to address challenges in the thermal science field through innovative discussions, research presentations from different areas, and knowledge sharing. The aim of the funding is to provide financial support for students and early-career professionals, enabling their participation in SHTC2025. \r\n\r\nSHTC2025 will feature technical sessions, keynote addresses, and panel discussions that emphasize cutting-edge research in heat transfer and its integration with energy solutions. The conference fosters interdisciplinary collaboration across topics such as nanotechnology, energy systems, thermal management, and biotechnology. The co-location of SHTC2025 with the ASME Energy Sustainability Conference expands opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. These discussions are designed to drive significant scientific progress and practical applications, supporting national objectives in energy efficiency. The initiative will also strengthen the educational and professional development of students and early-career professionals through technical presentations, poster sessions, and career-focused panels. By connecting students and early-career professionals with leading experts, SHTC2025 facilitates mentorship opportunities and fosters workforce development in heat transfer and thermal sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
