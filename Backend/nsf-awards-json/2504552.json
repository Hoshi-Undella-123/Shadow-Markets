 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of security solutions for the rapidly growing electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure. As the transportation sector transitions toward sustainable alternatives, the security of charging stations and their management systems has become increasingly critical. Recent research has indicated that charging station vendors are vulnerable to remote attacks, creating significant risks to users, infrastructure, and power grid stability. This technology addresses these vulnerabilities through advanced software and security measures, ensuring the safe operation of EV charging infrastructure. With the EV market growing, securing this critical infrastructure is essential to protect both individual users and the broader energy grid. The successful implementation of these security measures may accelerate the adoption of transportation solutions while maintaining the integrity and reliability of charging networks. The solution may also help prevent unauthorized access to charging systems, protect user data, and ensure the resilient operation of transportation infrastructure. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This technology is based on the development of intelligent security systems that leverage machine learning to analyze and protect vehicle charging infrastructure. The technology performs comprehensive semantic analysis of system components, enabling the identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities that traditional security methods often miss. This approach allows for deep inspection of software interactions and detection of potential risks unique to charging systems. The solution's ability to learn contextually correct vulnerability patterns from compiled code provides improved protection compared to conventional methods that rely solely on source code analysis. This technological advance enables proactive security measures that adapt to emerging threats while maintaining the operational efficiency of charging infrastructure. The system continuously monitors network traffic, analyzes system behavior patterns, and implements automated response mechanisms to prevent potential security breaches before they can impact critical infrastructure operations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
