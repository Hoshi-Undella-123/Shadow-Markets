 "awd_abstract_narration": "This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nWe live in an information-rich society where information can be both opportunity and burden. Tomorrow\u2019s researchers and professionals urgently need to improve competencies in handling and understanding the massive amount of one such type of information\u2014text data\u2014in an effective and scientific way. These competencies also include understanding how large language models such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude work and utilizing them with awareness and accountability. This program will support 12 REU students per summer in a research setting designed to build knowledge and skills in interdisciplinary research areas. A key point of distinction for this REU site is that it will provide an opportunity for social science majors to build technical skills in the application of human language technologies for research.\r\n\r\nThis REU program supports undergraduate students through a summer of science-, research-focused, hands-on, computational, and interdisciplinary learning experiences. Activities include social science text analysis research methods workshops, seminars, professional development, team-building opportunities, faculty research mentorship, and hands-on research project development and presentation. Students learn how to handle large text-based data, systematically conduct computational social science research, and be prepared for future academic or professional development. A key goal is to encourage students to sustain research interests in the context of subsequent educational activities and get exposure to research and text analysis that will benefit their future research and professional goals. This REU program is home to 35 undergraduate researchers from universities across the country. From the first two completed cohorts, at least four student researchers won conference awards and have papers published in conferences, and many have continued to graduate schools or PhD programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
