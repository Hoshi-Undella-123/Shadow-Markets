 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 2025 edition of the Seminar on Stochastic Processes (SSP), which will be held March 19\u201422 at Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana. The SSP is a major research conference series in the fields of probability and statistics, bringing together accomplished and early-career researchers across a range of areas. It has been held at over 20 different institutions over the last 40 years.  The SSP provides mathematicians and statisticians across a range of career stages a unique opportunity to interact, develop new collaborations, and discuss recent advances in their fields. Five invited speakers will deliver plenary lectures and tutorial lectures, including two distinguished plenary lectures, the SSP Founders lecture and the IMS Medallion lecture. There will be poster sessions with brief introductory talks, open problem discussion sessions, and a panel session on career development. This conference provides all participants an opportunity to interact and discuss recent advances in probability theory and stochastic processes and their applications. As such, the conference represents an important networking opportunity for the dozens of early-career researchers in attendance and it will enhance the careers of the next generation of researchers in stochastic processes.\r\n\r\nProbability is the mathematical theory that formalizes reasoning with incomplete information, and stochastic processes are probabilistic structures important both within mathematics and for modeling across a range of scientific fields. The scientific committee has chosen invited speakers whose work represents a wide breadth of research areas in probability and stochastic processes, including applications in complex networks, theoretical biology, and statistical physics. Recent research work by other participants will be presented at poster sessions. The open problem sessions provide opportunities for discussions about emerging and challenging topics in probability and stochastic processes and the formation of future collaborations. Further information on the SSP can be found on the conference website: https://ssp.stat.indiana.edu.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
