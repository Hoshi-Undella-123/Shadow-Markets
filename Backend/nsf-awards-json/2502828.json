 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Self-Healing Infrastructure with Nature-Based Enhancements (SHINE) project at Jackson State University aims perform research that looks to improve the durability and resilience of earthen infrastructure through innovative, sustainable engineering solutions. This project investigates the use of biopolymer-treated earthen materials with self-healing capabilities, allowing soil structures to recover from damage when exposed to moisture. By integrating biopolymers\u2014natural materials with unique bonding properties, SHINE seeks to develop self-repairing soils that enhance infrastructure stability, reduce maintenance costs, and improve environmental sustainability. Beyond advancing engineering science, SHINE will contribute to workforce development by engaging undergraduate students in research, incorporating findings into undergraduate and K-12 STEM education, and fostering collaborations with community colleges. This project aligns with NSF\u2019s mission to promote scientific progress while enhancing national resilience against natural disasters, improving public safety, and supporting sustainable infrastructure development.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research project is to develop an innovative strategy for biopolymer-treated earthen materials that exhibit self-healing properties, improving the long-term stability of critical soil-based infrastructure. The research investigates the mechanisms of self-healing biopolymers in sandy, silty, and clayey soils under varying environmental conditions, including moisture fluctuations, seepage, and external erosion forces. The hypothesis is that biopolymers create a dynamic, reversible bonding network that enables self-repair when soil structures experience damage. The project involves macro- and micro-scale experiments to assess self-healing performance, including unconfined compressive strength tests, scanning electron microscopy imaging, and erosion function apparatus tests. It also evaluates the long-term durability of biopolymer-treated earthen materials under biodegradation, wet-dry cycles, and UV exposure. The research findings seek to provide new insights into nature-based soil stabilization methods, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional chemical stabilizers. The project will also integrate research into STEM education, training undergraduate and graduate students, and fostering collaborations with the Mississippi Department of Transportation, community colleges, and K-12 educators. The outcomes will contribute to enhancing the resilience of earthen infrastructure and advancing sustainable geotechnical engineering practices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
