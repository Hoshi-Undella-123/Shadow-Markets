 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) Pilot was launched in January 2024 to provide a shared national research infrastructure to bridge the gap in access to artificial intelligence (AI) resources to conduct research and train the next generation of researchers.  The NAIRR Pilot is designed to spur innovation, increase the pool of talent, improve capacity, and advance safe, secure, and trustworthy AI in research and society.  The project aims to build strong connections among the existing NAIRR researchers and institutions and individual participants across the U.S., especially those who would not typically engage in NSF research.\r\n\r\nThis project is an innovative, evidence-based program aimed at expanding access to NAIRR by matching NAIRR researchers with a small cohort of faculty and students from a variety of academic institutions to establish research collaborations through a 10-week onsite summer experience followed by the presentation of results at a national professional society conference.  This pilot project represents a high-risk and high-reward effort to establish new ways of cultivating AI talent poised to address the nation's pressing challenges.  While the proposed approach is novel and untested in the NSF community, it can develop into a new paradigm for expanding access to NAIRR while making significant progress in making AI accessible to all and providing a broader spectrum of perspectives for creating new AI models and methods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
