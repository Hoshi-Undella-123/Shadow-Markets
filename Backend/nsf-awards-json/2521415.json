 "awd_abstract_narration": "Breakthroughs in materials science consistently drive progress in information technologies and beyond. Recently, there has been growing interest in materials with properties driven by macroscopic quantum phenomena. The University of Kansas partners with the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln to harness the convergence of two such quantum phenomena: magnetism and the unique physics of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Confined to a 2D \"flatland\", materials can exhibit novel magnetic and electric properties enabling devices with unprecedented functionalities. Experts from two jurisdictions across physics, chemistry, materials science, and engineering will stack and twist atomically thin 2D layers to form artificial structures not found in nature. Insights gleaned from studying their magnetic and electronic behavior will inform the design of next-generation devices including energy-efficient memory and logic components. A key outcome will be the education of future materials scientists and building of a quantum-ready workforce to boost Kansas and Nebraska\u2019s economy. Education and outreach efforts will raise public awareness and inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration between the University of Kansas and University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln will combine complementary expertise in synthesis, nanofabrication, characterization, sensing, and theory to advance both the science and device applications of artificial two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials. 2D magnetic and ferroelectric materials, along with their layered and twisted heterostructures, unlock novel quantum states and enable applications that go beyond traditional silicon-based electronics. Realizing their potential requires understanding of structure including Moir\u00e9 modulations, electronic and magnetic states, and emergent interfacial effects. The team will employ probes sensitive to structural, electronic, and magnetic properties across multiple length scales to establish an integrated cycle of novel synthesis, characterization, and device fabrication. Existing infrastructure, such as the Nebraska Center for Materials and Nanoscience, will benefit from the project through increase and broadening of the user base and utilization of unique instrumentation including the first commercial nitrogen vacancy low temperature scanning microscope in the US. The project is essential to educate a quantum-ready workforce, necessary for the economic growth of both jurisdictions, and to attract the next generation of scientists and quantum materials engineers. This project is supported by the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (FEC), which supports interjurisdictional teams of EPSCoR investigators to perform research in topics that align with NSF priorities, with the goals of driving discovery and building sustainable STEM capacity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
