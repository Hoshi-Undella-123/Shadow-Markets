 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project at Colorado Mountain College (CMC) aligns with national, state and regional priorities by addressing workforce needs in the rapidly growing electric vehicle (EV) market, supporting Colorado's ambitious EV adoption targets. Colorado Mountain College (CMC) will launch a three-year project aimed at building the foundations of an EV Maintenance and Charging (EVMC) Program and evaluating its effectiveness. Curricula for this project will be integrated into its Automotive Service Technology framework to offer stackable credentials and accessible training for high school, traditional college, and non-traditional students. Key activities of this project include faculty development, curriculum customization, specialized equipment acquisition, and stakeholder advisory input, ensuring alignment with workforce demands. The EVMC Program will enroll CMC students, the public, and employees of the automotive industry. CMC's internal combustion engine program alone enrolls over 250 students annually. By 2027, the goal is to enroll 30 students per year in this program to enhance workforce access and economic resilience in rural Colorado. Leveraging proven curricula and stakeholder partnerships, the project will serve as a scalable model for nationwide impact while addressing critical gaps in EV education and training.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to establish a comprehensive EVMC Program to address growing workforce demands. This research will evaluate the effectiveness of developed curricula in EV Maintenance and EV Charging, addressing their impact on 1) participants' skill acquisition and 2) industry readiness. Findings will inform curriculum development and workforce training programs, contributing to the sustainable growth of the EV sector. Key objectives include equipping faculty with advanced EV training, developing an EV-specific curriculum, forming a regional consortium and Advisory Board, acquiring specialized equipment, and sharing best practices. The EVMC program will integrate EV-focused courses into CMC's certificates and associated degrees, offering stackable credentials that lead up to a bachelor's degree. By advancing technology fields in Colorado's Western Slope region, this project aligns with the nation's rapidly growing workforce needs and serves as a model for advancing EV workforce capacity, educational access, and rural economic development. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
