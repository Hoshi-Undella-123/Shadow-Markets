 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymers are essential in today\u2019s technologies from flexible electronics to energy-efficient lighting and renewable energy systems. However, their poor heat conduction capability limits their applications where effective thermal management is critical. When heat does not move away effectively, devices can become less efficient, last for shorter time periods, and be less useful in demanding applications like high-power electronics and solar panels. This project explores a novel approach to improve heat flow in polymers and their composites by using special energy carriers that combine light and material vibrations. These special energy carriers are created by coating tiny structures, such as nanowires and polymer nanofibers, with a thin layer of metals. Led by Tennessee State University in collaboration with Vanderbilt University, the research aims to overcome a key challenge in materials science, which could lead to more dependable and efficient technology. The findings could transform industries by supporting the development of advanced devices that handle heat effectively, saving energy and enhancing performance. Additionally, the project supports students in learning innovative research, preparing them for careers in science and engineering and contributing to the advancement of materials science.\r\n\r\nThe research seeks to understand how these energy carriers, created by coupling light with material vibrations and called surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs), can enhance heat conduction in polymers and their composites. The team will conduct experiments by coating nanowires and polymer fibers with metals to stimulate these carriers and measure their effects on heat flow across various polymer systems. Advanced microscopy will reveal structural details, while theoretical models will analyze how these carriers function at both nanoscale and bulk levels. The work aims to address a major limitation in polymer composites - high thermal resistance at interfaces - potentially achieving significant improvements in heat conduction. This could lead to breakthroughs in designing materials for electronics, lighting, and renewable energy applications. By providing new insights into heat transport mechanisms, the project advances the field of materials science. Through training students and expanding institutional research capabilities, the project supports the development of skilled researchers and strengthens the infrastructure for cutting-edge scientific innovation and establishment of quantum materials research and education programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
