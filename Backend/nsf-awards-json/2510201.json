 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of undergraduate students enrolled at HBCUs so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. This project contributes to HBCU-UP program goals through an innovative approach to preparing undergraduate students for careers in the quantum information science and engineering workforce. Using a three-step approach - Inspire, Educate, and Experience, the project creates opportunities for undergraduate STEM students at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University to build foundational knowledge and awareness of quantum science. This initiative is essential for preparing the next generation of quantum professionals to meet the demands of this rapidly evolving field and the emerging technologies workforce.\r\n\r\nThe Inspire, Educate, Experience approach to quantum information science and engineering includes developing and implementing quantum course modules and experiments, designing a dedicated course grounded in a spiral learning model and enhanced through visualization tools, and fostering crucial connections between students, researchers, and industry professionals, deepening student engagement with the field. The project establishes a structured pathway that supports student engagement from freshman through senior year. Through targeted modules, introductory courses, and invaluable networking opportunities, the project promotes the development of skills that facilitate internships, research collaborations, and career prospects. Educational materials are made available online, allowing other institutions to establish their own quantum-related courses and contribute to a coordinated, national effort to expand the quantum workforce. This systematic, multi-step approach ensures sustained interest and growth in quantum-related careers, ultimately preparing students for success in this rapidly advancing field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
