 "awd_abstract_narration": "Detecting low-energy particles with high spatial and energy resolution remains a challenge in experimental neutrino physics, the search for dark matter, and high-precision medical imaging. Germanium (Ge) detectors with internal charge amplification and multiple strip contacts offer a promising solution to the challenge. This project will advance Ge material research and detector technology using artificial intelligence (AI) and innovative fabrication techniques. Led by the University of South Dakota (USD), this statewide collaboration includes six institutions in South Dakota. Project partners include PhD-granting universities USD, South Dakota State University, and South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, alongside undergraduate institutions Black Hills State University, Dakota State University, and Mount Marty University. Two industry partners, Avera Health and Sanford Health, will contribute expertise in medical imaging. This project will enhance STEM education and workforce development by recruiting four faculty members and eight postdoctoral researchers, while also providing hands-on training to 100 college students and engaging 380 K-12 students and teachers across South Dakota.\r\n\r\nThe project will advance AI-driven Ge crystal growth and detector technology to enhance the detection of low-energy particles and accuracy of medical imaging. The project will explore and implement Ge Internal Charge Amplification technology to improve the detection of terahertz radiation from low-mass dark matter and neutrinos via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, offering new insights into fundamental particle and astroparticle physics. AI-based algorithms will optimize Ge purification, crystal growth, and detector fabrication, reduce inefficiencies, and improve detector sensitivity. Ge detectors using strip contact technology will facilitate high-precision medical imaging for earlier diagnoses and more accurate radiation therapy. Furthermore, the initiative will evaluate the impact of advanced imaging on healthcare in local communities. The project will foster more scientific, technical, and economic innovation by supporting early career faculty development and expanding laboratory capabilities. Cutting-edge physics and engineering research will be strengthened through integration with the Sanford Underground Research Facility. This project is supported by the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: EPSCoR Research Incubators for STEM Excellence (E-RISE). E-RISE supports the development of sustainable research infrastructure and capacity in EPSCoR jurisdictions through collaborative, hypothesis-driven, or problem-driven research and workforce development to improve competitiveness in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
