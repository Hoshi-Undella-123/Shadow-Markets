 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST), this project aims to address a critical challenge in the U.S. semiconductor industry, enabling low cost yet high-performance computation. Innovation in semiconductors is essential for modern computing. This project will transform research and education at Boise State University by integrating semiconductor science into classrooms and increasing student engagement. In collaboration with industry partners, the project will provide hands-on experience in semiconductor fabrication, device innovation, and computational materials design. This approach will support economic growth, strengthen national security, and inspire the next generation of engineers, ensuring Idaho and the nation remain leaders in semiconductor technology. \r\n\r\nThe project bridges research and workforce development through four areas: machine learning-driven materials discovery, atomic-scale thin-film fabrication, energy-efficient semiconductor devices, and neuromorphic computing architectures. Researchers will develop advanced ferroelectric materials, refine nanoscale deposition techniques, and create computing systems for low-power, high-performance applications. This research is incorporated into STEM mentorship programs, and workforce training in partnership with local industry. In sum, the project will enhance semiconductor education and contribute to the future of microelectronics innovation. The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program provides support to enhance the research capabilities of institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
