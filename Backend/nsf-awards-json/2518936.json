 "awd_abstract_narration": "Producing unfamiliar sound sequences, such as complex consonant clusters, is a persistent challenge in both second language acquisition and speech rehabilitation. Previous research suggests that improving the ability to hear subtle differences between sounds may enhance how these sounds are produced. This doctoral dissertation project investigates whether targeted listening practice enhances the precision of articulatory coordination during speech. Participants complete structured listening and speaking exercises over several weeks, while sensors track movements of their tongue, lips, and jaw. The knowledge gained from this project supports biotechnology applications including the design of more targeted and effective strategies for teaching speech production, delivering therapy, and assisting individuals recovering from speech impairments. This project also benefits society by providing educational opportunities and workforce development skills for students.\r\n\r\nThis doctoral dissertation project investigates whether perceptual training enhances articulatory coordination during the production of unfamiliar consonant clusters. Grounded in theories of speech learning and motor control, the study compares two groups: one that receives both perceptual training and speaking practice, with another group that receives speaking practice alone. Participants in both groups complete listening tasks with immediate feedback and repeat novel sound sequences while their speech movements are recorded with electromagnetic articulography. The research tracks changes in perceptual accuracy, response time, and articulatory coordination over time. Using statistical modeling, the study evaluates whether perceptual improvement precedes or accompanies improvements in speech production. The results offer new insight into the link between perception and motor control, with applications for education, rehabilitation, speech technology, and biotechnology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
