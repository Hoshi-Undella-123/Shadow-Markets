 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Western Algebraic Geometry Symposium (WAGS) is a twice-yearly meeting of algebraic geometers in the western United States. The next WAGS meeting is tentatively scheduled to take place October 18-19, 2025 at the University or Oregon. The Spring meeting is scheduled to take place at the University of California, San Diego in April 2026. The conference meetings consist of a number of talks presenting new research in algebraic geometry and adjacent fields, together with more informal activities designed to connect graduate students and younger researchers with professors. WAGS serves as a crucial tool to support algebraic geometry researchers and students throughout the region. WAGS provides an opportunity for algebraic geometers in the region to come together and hear a semester's worth of seminars and meet at length with each other over the course of the weekend meeting. Special attention is given to the experience of graduate students and early-career researchers.\r\n\r\nWAGS aims to build a regional community among algebraic geometers of all career stages, from advanced undergraduates to full professors. The meetings are centered around research talks delivered by leading mathematicians from around the world, highlighting exciting recent results in and around algebraic geometry. In addition to the research talks, the typical WAGS meeting also includes poster sessions and other organized opportunities for interaction among participants. More information can be found on the WAGs website at https://sites.google.com/a/wagsymposium.org/current/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
