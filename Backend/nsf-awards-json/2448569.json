 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of US-based graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to a conference titled \u201cSingularities in Algebra and Geometry\u201d being held June 15-21, 2025, in Guanajuato, Mexico. The conference will take place on the premises of Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Matem\u00e1ticas in Guanajuato, which has a long tradition of successful international events. Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra are among the oldest yet most vibrant branches of mathematics, and have important applications throughout the sciences in light of the rich structure and computational elegance of polynomial equations. The conference \u201cSingularities in Algebra and Geometry\u201d will bring together leading experts in these and related areas, fostering an exchange of ideas and methodologies and further enriching this dynamic field. This conference will also include substantial mentoring and training for young researchers, helping to stimulate collaboration and cultivate peer-support networks. This will enhance retention, improve future job opportunities, and foster their future success in the STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe specific focus of the conference is on recent advances in Commutative Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, and related areas including Arithmetic Geometry and Noncommutative Algebra, with a common theme being the study of singularities. Over the past decade, these fields have experienced spectacular advances due to the cross-fertilization of techniques and perspectives. These developments have also made significant impacts in other areas, including cluster algebras and number theory, while at the same time borrowing heavily from insights in those fields. More information can be found on the conference website: https://sites.google.com/view/singularitiesalggeom2025.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
