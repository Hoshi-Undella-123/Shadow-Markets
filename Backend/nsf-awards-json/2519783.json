 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to continue the BLAST conference series through the years 2025-2027. The BLAST conference series focuses on topics in the Foundations of Mathematics, and funding for the 2025-2027 conferences supports the 15th through 17th meetings of this series. The 2025 meeting will be held at the University of Colorado at Boulder, the 2026 meeting will be held at Baylor University, and the 2027 meeting will be held at the University of Notre Dame. These meetings aim to connect junior researchers with leading national and international experts, to provide an introduction to current topics in the Foundations of Mathematics, to share recent advancements, and to encourage collaborative research. This award will support the participation of the invited speakers, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and other recent Ph.D. recipients.\r\n\r\nThe acronym BLAST stands for ``Boolean algebra, algebraic Logic, general Algebra, Set theory, and set-theoretic Topology''. These areas are the major themes of the conference series. BLAST organizers also welcome talks from participants who connect these algebraic and set-theoretical tools to other areas such as model theory, theoretical computer science, software verification, and automated theorem proving. Each year, the conference program typically consists of eight 1-hour plenary talks in the BLAST areas of research, three longer tutorials on specialized current topics, and a large number of contributed talks. The website for the conference series is https://math.colorado.edu/blast/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
