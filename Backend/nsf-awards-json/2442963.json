 "awd_abstract_narration": "The release of potentially toxic micro- and nano-plastics from polymer products poses significant health and environmental concerns. Substantial levels of exposure to these toxins can occur through the use of plastic containers for food and beverages, and there is particular concern when vulnerable population segments such as young children are exposed these micro- and nano-plastics. Despite these concerns and increasing awareness of the potential harm caused by these materials, the mechanism by which micro- and nano-plastics are released from plastic products is currently unknown. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports research that aims to uncover the key material and processing factors that control the release of micro- and nano-plastics, so that design of safer polymer materials and manufacturing methods becomes possible. This project will include educational outreach programs at the elementary school level to enable opportunities for young students to connect engineering and science with real-world examples, and to attract and train the future STEM workforce. Graduate and undergraduate researchers will be involved in the educational activities, which will enrich their communication skills and foster a commitment to educating future STEM workers.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this CAREER project is to obtain a fundamental understanding of the relationship between material, processing, structure, and release behavior of micro- and nano-plastics during use of polymer products with potential for human ingestion. Currently, the potential interplay between material characteristics, processing methods, and particle release behavior is unknown, preventing the development of a predictive model. To address this critical gap in knowledge, this research will use well-controlled materials and processing conditions, and will characterize release behavior using state-of-the-art experimental techniques to detect and identify particles. The results will provide new understanding of the basic fragmentation mechanism by which micro- and nano-plastics are generated, and will uncover the key parameters that dictate particle release. This knowledge will open up the path towards a transformational shift to manufacturing where nano- and micro-plastic release is incorporated as a performance criterion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
