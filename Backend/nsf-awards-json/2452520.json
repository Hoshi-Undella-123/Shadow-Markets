 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experiential learning opportunities relevant to Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) are scarce, especially for students at the associate, undergraduate and master\u2019s levels or for early/mid-career professionals seeking upskilling. While theoretical knowledge is essential, hands-on experiences using real-world equipment and facilities play a crucial role in deepening understanding and fostering practical skills. Unfortunately, due to the complex and specialized nature of quantum systems, students face challenges in securing access to labs, real-world experiments, or interactive simulations. As a result, they often lack the experience and skills desired by employers such as operating cryogenic, vacuum or laser systems; manipulating quantum states; designing, fabricating and characterizing devices and circuits, and observing quantum phenomena, among other industry-relevant experiences. This ultimately hinders the development of a qualified quantum-ready workforce. A workshop that focuses on addressing this gap will engage stakeholders from industry and academia to define the characteristics of accessible and useful experiential learning opportunities that will significantly enhance students\u2019 grasp of important skills required to work in quantum research and development and better prepare them to succeed in this rapidly advancing field.\r\n\r\nThe Quantum Learning through Experiential Activities and Practice (Q-LEAP) workshop will be held on October 29 in Seattle, WA.  It will be organized by representatives of the Quantum Economic Development Consortium.  The Q-LEAP workshop will gather stakeholder input on the skills and experiences most sought-after by those who hire technical workers along with recommendations and guidance for hands-on quantum activities and real-world learning experiences that can be incorporated into experiential learning programs at universities, community colleges or other educational institutions and organizations. The workshop and an associated report will help to inform educators and employers on ways to create meaningful training opportunities, reduce identified gaps in learning, improve job prospects for program participants, and enable a wider community of educators and employers to learn from best practices as they launch their own activities to develop and strengthen the talent pipeline. Funding for this workshop is jointly provided by the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, the NSF Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships, and the NSF Directorate for STEM Education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
