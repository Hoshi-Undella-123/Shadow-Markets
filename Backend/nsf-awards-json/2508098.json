 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Young Topologist Meeting 2025 will take place June 23-27, 2025, in Stockholm, Sweden at the Royal Institute of Technology and at Stockholm University. This conference, the last in a conference series that has been held annually since 2007 gathers young researchers: graduate students and recently graduated postdoctoral researchers for a combination between mini-courses on groundbreaking advances and open questions in topology, and presentations by the participants of their own research. This provides a unique opportunity for junior topologists to gain experience giving conference presentations, to learn about disciplines not represented at their schools, and cultivate contacts with a wider network of peers. The conferences have broader impacts both through the world-wide networking opportunities, and through a carefully created friendly and cooperative gathering space, creating space for students to participate and focuses on supporting a wide range of students.\r\n\r\nThis year\u2019s mini-course speakers work in motivic homotopy theory (Maria Yakerson), geometric topology (Manuel Krannich), and topological data analysis (Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chazal). The organizers anticipate between 130 and 200 participants, and this grant would serve to help a number of US-based graduate students with travel expenses to enable them to draw on these resources and opportunities. The conference webpage can be found here: https://www.math-stockholm.se/en/kalender/konferens/ytm2025-1.1350169\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
