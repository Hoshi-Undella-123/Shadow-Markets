 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support student and early career scientist travel to the 43rd annual American Association for Aerosol Research (AAAR) conference. The AAAR conference brings together engineers and scientists from academia, industry, government, national labs, and non-governmental organizations with a common interest in aerosol science. The attendees have a background in a range of fields including atmospheric sciences, engineering, basic sciences, public health, and toxicology. This experience can mold and advance the scientific careers of young researchers.\r\n\r\nThe conference will take place on October 13-17, 2025, in Buffalo, NY. A total of around 800 attendees are expected. Each year abstracts are submitted to Special Symposia, which are current hot topics in aerosol science, as well as 16 topical areas including: (1) Aerosol Chemistry, (2) Aerosol Exposure, (3) Aerosol Physics, (4) Aerosols and Clouds, (5) Bioaerosols, (6) Carbonaceous Aerosols, (7) Combustion, (8) Control and Mitigation Technology, (9) Health-Related Aerosols, (10) History of Aerosol Science, (11) Indoor Aerosols, (12) Instrumentation and Methods, (13) Nanoparticles and Material Synthesis, (14) Remote and Regional Aerosols, (15), Source Apportionment and (16) Urban Aerosols.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
