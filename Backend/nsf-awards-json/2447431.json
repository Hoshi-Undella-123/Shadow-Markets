 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to Syracuse University, located in Syracuse, NY, supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2025-2027.  In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry, students gain valuable research experience, develop professional skills and confidence as they progress towards careers in STEM related fields. Participants also learn methods and techniques through hands-on experience, practice science communication through one-on-one discussions, group meetings and presentations, and gain new insights on chemistry education and career possibilities.  The REU site is committed to motivating students to continue research and to explore the opportunities that chemistry offers. \r\n \r\nIn this REU program, students conduct research side-by-side with faculty and student mentors, through projects that include organic and inorganic synthesis, spectroscopy and other physical measurements, computational methods, preparation and characterization of materials, and biochemical studies of proteins and DNA.  Students additionally benefit from the highly collaborative environment provided by the chemical community at Syracuse University, state-of-the-art facilities, and opportunities to communicate and disseminate their accomplishments in written and oral forms.\r\n\r\nThis Site is supported in part by funds provided to the National Science Foundation by the Semiconductor Research Corporation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
