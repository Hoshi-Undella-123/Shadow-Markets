 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by equipping two-year college students with research skills and hands-on experiences that prepare students to transfer to four-year universities, pursue advanced degrees, and engage in competitive STEM careers. This initiative is critically important for expanding access to high demand fields and strengthening the nation's scientific workforce. Through an integrated approach that draws on biology, biotechnology, mathematics and data science, students take part in fieldwork, laboratory investigations, and statistical analysis.  The project also provides opportunities for students to collaborate with peers and mentors as part of the research experience. These activities build on one another and culminate in student presentations at professional conferences. Ultimately, the project supports broader efforts to grow a skilled and engaged STEM workforce equipped to contribute to the country's innovation economy.\r\n\r\nThe project goals are to: 1) strengthen cross-departmental collaboration at a two-year college and build a framework for future research programs, 2) provide a hands-on, extended research experiences in field biology, biotechnology, and data science, and 3) support retention and transfer success of students in STEM fields. To advance these goals, the project involves the development of a fellowship program grounded in existing curriculum frameworks and enriched by program specific workshops that offer mentoring, technical research experience, and student stipends. The three-semester fellowship culminates in a capstone assignment through which students present their findings in a public showcase. The project also seeks to expand collaboration among biology, biotechnology, and mathematics departments by engaging faculty in interdisciplinary work that lays the groundwork for a sustained research initiative at the college. Assessment and evaluation efforts include the use of surveys, group interviews, and institutional data to examine the project's impact on faculty collaboration, student skill development, and transfer outcomes. Dissemination efforts include student and faculty presentations and contributions to relevant journals. By embedding interdisciplinary research within the two-year college setting, the project highlights the critical role these institutions play in shaping accessible, high impact STEM learning pathways. The NSF IUSE: Innovation in Two-Year College STEM Education (ITYC) Program seeks to accelerate and advance knowledge about the impact of emerging and evidence-based practices in undergraduate STEM education at two-year colleges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
