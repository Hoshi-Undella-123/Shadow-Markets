 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of an innovative concrete curing technology that utilizes highly absorptive recycled polymers to address challenges associated with current labor- and resource-intensive curing operations. This cost-effective and proactive solution simplifies the traditional curing process by eliminating the need for spraying water or chemical compounds, thereby saving time, labor, and resources on construction sites while ensuring high-quality concrete with enhanced strength and durability. The improved curing technology minimizes premature failures and extends the lifespan of concrete infrastructure, delivering broader societal benefits such as enhanced public safety and reduced maintenance costs. This innovation supports environmentally friendly, sustainable, and resilient concrete construction practices and offers a viable solution for infrastructure projects across multiple scales.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a cost-effective, easy-to-implement, and scalable concrete curing technology that enhances the durability and longevity of concrete infrastructure. The core innovation integrates a highly absorptive internal curing agent, known as superabsorbent polymers, into concrete mixtures. These materials absorb excess water during concrete mixing and gradually release it during curing, promoting cement hydration. This approach eliminates the reliance on conventional external curing, which typically requires intensive monitoring and additional quality control efforts yet often fails to adequately hydrate the inner portions of concrete. This core technology not only improves the long-term mechanical properties of concrete, but also helps mitigate common issues in reinforced concrete structures, such as shrinkage cracking and rebar corrosion, contributing to more sustainable and resilient infrastructure. More importantly, this innovation uses recycled superabsorbent polymers from discarded hygiene or food packaging products. This preserves the functional benefits of the material while reducing resource consumption and production costs, offering a sustainable solution for the cement, concrete, and construction industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
