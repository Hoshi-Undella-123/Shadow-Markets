 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biomedical and Health Informatics Conference (BHI) is a premier flagship conference sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS), that focuses on informatics and computing in healthcare and life sciences. BHI\u201925 will take place from October 26 to 29, 2025, in Atlanta, Georgia. The theme of BHI\u201925 is \u201cPrecision Health: AI Tailored to Individuals.\u201d It will provide a unique platform for cross-disciplinary researchers to showcase their research on big data analytics and machine learning, addressing challenges in biomedicine. An important mission of BHI\u201925 is to promote the participation and engagement of undergraduate and graduate students, particularly first-time attendees. The NSF Student Travel Award will support this goal by providing travel awards to qualified students from US institutions to attend the conference.\r\n\r\nWith NSF support, the investigator expects to provide travel awards to approximately 28 student participants to encourage their attendance at BHI\u201925. The conference will offer student awardees opportunities to present their research, expand their knowledge, network with world-class researchers, and widen their collaborations. Additionally, participants will have access to keynote speeches from world-renowned researchers, career and technology panels, special sessions, workshops, and tutorials. The investigator will particularly encourage the participation and engagement of first-time undergraduate and graduate student attendees to the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
