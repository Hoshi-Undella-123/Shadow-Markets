 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides domestic travel support for US-based Ph.D. students to attend the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, (SIAM), International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2025) and for the Doctoral Student Forum, which will be held in Alexandria Virginia, U.S in May 1\u20133, 2025. The award will be advertised and announced on the SDM 2025 website as well as various data mining mailing lists. SDM is an annual conference that presents the world\u2019s premier research in data mining, bringing together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government. The conference includes keynote talks from invited speakers, technical programs, specialized workshops, tutorials, Blue Sky Idea papers and Doctoral Student Forum. Participation in conferences is an important aspect of the educational experience of graduate students. Through participation in SDM 2025, students interested in pursuing research in data mining can interact with peers who share similar interests from other universities, as well as hundreds of leading re-searchers in data mining from around the world. Its proceedings are published both in archival form and on the SIAM website. \r\n\r\nParticipation in premier research conferences in data mining is an integral component of the training of Ph.D. students in data mining. The SDM 2025 Doctoral Student Forum aims to provide an opportunity for Ph.D. students to present their work and receive constructive feedback and mentoring from established researchers in data mining. Such feedback and mentoring are expected to improve the quality of the student\u2019s thesis research. The Doctoral Forum participants will be able to interact with their peers from other universities as well as hundreds of leading researchers in data mining from around the world. In addition, they will attend the technical sessions, plenary talks, panels, tutorials and workshops of their choice at the conference. Similarly, student recipients of the travel award will be able to attend the conference technical programs and interact with peers and senior researchers. All doctoral students will be invited to attend a mentoring panel to discuss a variety of career-related issues. This experience altogether will be extremely formative and fruitful towards the shaping of their future research endeavor\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
