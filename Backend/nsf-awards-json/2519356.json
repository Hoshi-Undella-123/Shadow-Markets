 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasing demand for expertise in quantum computing and cybersecurity presents both a national challenge and an opportunity. By 2035, quantum computing is expected to generate nearly $700 billion in value, yet the talent pipeline remains limited, with only one qualified candidate for every three job openings. Meanwhile, the number of cybersecurity jobs are projected to grow by 35% between 2021 and 2031. Despite the urgent workforce needs in both domains, there is a lack of integrated, experiential learning opportunities that foster cross-disciplinary skills. This project addresses that gap by creating cloud-based educational modules that blend quantum computing and cybersecurity through hands-on, collaborative learning experiences. The project supports national priorities by preparing a future-ready STEM workforce and promoting collaboration across institutions of different types.\r\n\r\nThis award supports the development of a cyberinfrastructure-based platform for experiential learning in quantum computing and cybersecurity. The project includes the design and implementation of new interdisciplinary learning modules, integration of these modules into existing courses, and delivery of the faculty development workshop and the student summer camp. Modules will include tutorials and hands-on labs using cloud platforms, making them scalable and adaptable across different institutional contexts. Faculty and students at the New York Institute of Technology and the University of South Florida will collaborate on course development, module testing, and implementation. Through formative and summative evaluation, the project will improve teaching materials and support nationwide dissemination and adoption. This initiative will contribute to curriculum innovation, faculty training, and the preparation of a skilled workforce equipped to address the emerging challenges and opportunities in quantum computing and cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
