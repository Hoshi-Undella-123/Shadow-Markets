 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wildfires have become more frequent and intense over the last few decades due to extreme heat and drought conditions. A major health risk associated with wildfires is increased ambient air pollution, most notably increased nanoscale particulate matter, which can affect populations hundreds of miles away and result in adverse environmental and health effects. The recent wildfires in Los Angeles burned biomass and human-made structures, such as buildings, furnishings and vehicles, which resulted in the release of nanoparticles with complicated physical and chemical properties and unique toxicological profiles.  Without extensive characterization of the nanoparticle emissions, the potential environmental and health risks to affected populations remain unknown.  This project will provide that characterization of emissions by analyzing nanoparticle and fly ash samples that have been collected in the Los Angeles area.  In addition, the project will create training opportunities for students at the interface of environmental science, nanobiology, and nanotoxicology, promote collaborations across institutions, and stimulate community engagement.\r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary RAPID research project will enable the analysis of integrated samples of wildfire-emitted particulate matter, fly ash, and gaseous pollutants from multiple locations in Los Angeles. Leveraging the  interdisciplinary existing expertise of the investigators,  the complex physicochemical properties of nanoparticles  and fly ash samples will be assessed using state-of-the-art analytical methods. In addition, the impact of inhalable nanoparticles and resuspended fly ash on human health will be assessed using cellular models.  The proposed work has significant implications for environmental health and community resilience in wildfire disasters and for assessing environmental nanoparticles in general. Findings will inform public health risk assessors and communities and help develop strategies for mitigating health risks from fires at the wildland-urban interface.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
