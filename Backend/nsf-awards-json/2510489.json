 "awd_abstract_narration": "Implementation Projects in the Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provide support to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the numbers of students receiving undergraduate degrees in STEM and build STEM education research capacity. This implementation project at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) aims to integrate immersive virtual reality (VR) and metacognitive skill development into STEM education courses focusing on enhancing student academic experiences and helping students overcome barriers to completing STEM programs of study. Specifically, the project identifies a critical role for faculty professional development to curate VR-focused curricular enhancements that are designed to equip students with the skills needed for future careers in STEM through the implementation of 3-D simulated virtual labs, collaborative exercises, hands-on learning. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to enhance STEM student engagement broadly, deepen students\u2019 understanding of complex STEM topics, foster cognitive and metacognitive skill development, and improve overall retention rates for all participating students. Specifically, specialized VR modules will be developed and tailored for each STEM discipline (Computer Science, Engineering Fundamentals, Physics, Biology, Mathematics, Biomedical Engineering, and Construction Management). In addition, structured seminars focused on essential cognitive and metacognitive competencies, including time management, goal setting, study strategies, and critical thinking will be implemented. Utilizing a comprehensive mixed-methods evaluation approach, the project will systematically assess academic performance outcomes, as well as metacognitive skill enhancements. If successfully implemented, the project outcomes may inform best practices for VR engagement and its impact on student learning, acclimation, and retention in STEM at UMES, which may also provide universal strategies that can be implemented on a national scale, across a variety of institutions of higher education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
