 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will create computer models of the very first galaxies and black holes to form in the Universe. New observations have discovered extremely distant galaxies, some of these galaxies appear more massive and evolved than expected by current models. Through computer simulations, this program will make an important contribution to establishing the new models needed to properly explain the recent observations of the most distant galaxies. To make the scientific results of this program available to everyone, the PIs will design and fabricate dozens of 3D-printed models from various simulated galaxies and any interesting structures within them. These 3D-printed models will be displayed in outreach events and art exhibits.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative proposal will deliver theoretical and observational predictions for galaxy and Super-Massive Black Hole (SMBH) formation and growth during Cosmic Dawn with a particular focus on galaxies with overly massive black holes. Specifically, this proposal will investigate if galaxies in the early universe with and without a black hole seed can be distinguished observationally. Using the exascale-capable code Enzo-E, this program will carry out simulations of high-redshift galaxy formation, accounting for SMBH fueling, feedback models and their impact on the circumgalactic medium. The principal goal of this work is to determine the observational signatures of a galaxy that has hosted a massive black hole seed. This proposal will provide a basis for training astrophysical simulations enhanced by Artificial Intelligence. This proposed work will provide a breadth of research opportunities for the professional development of undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
