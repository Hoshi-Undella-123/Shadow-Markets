 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds planning activities for a proposed new Industry University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC), the Center for Smart Manufacturing using AI-based Revolutionary Technologies (SMART). The SMART center is led by the University of Alabama (UA) in partnership with the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). Advancements in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have profoundly impacted numerous fields. However, the manufacturing sector has faced challenges in integrating AI at the same pace. The SMART center will leverage data collected through sensors and cameras during the manufacturing process to create and integrate AI technologies that transform the manufacturing sector, delivering enhanced productivity, product quality, factory sustainability, and workforce safety. The center aims to enhance the global strength and competitiveness of the U.S. manufacturing industry, which plays a critical role in economic stability and growth while sustaining technological leadership in key sectors including automotive, aerospace, electronics, and pharmaceuticals. The SMART center is also dedicated to workforce development through specialized training programs that will equip workers with the skillset essential for 21st-century industries. Through a collaborative approach involving universities, industry leaders, and government agencies, the SMART center aligns with national priorities to bolster economic resilience and advance technological innovation.\r\n\r\nThe mission of the SMART center is to foster collaborations among stakeholders in advanced manufacturing to conduct and disseminate applied, pre-competitive research on AI-driven technologies, methodologies, and tools that enable the transformation of the manufacturing sector. The SMART center\u2019s research focuses on four thrust areas: manufacturing productivity, product quality, factory sustainability, and workforce safety. By leveraging advanced AI and machine learning (ML) technologies, including deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language models, these efforts aim to: (i) optimize various aspects of manufacturing processes, (ii) improve product quality through advanced defect detection systems utilizing analytics and deep neural networks, (iii) enhance resource sustainability by improving energy efficiency and reducing waste, and (iv) boost workplace safety through real-time monitoring and predictive analysis of potential hazards. The UA site will specifically focus on vision-based technologies for manufacturing productivity, product quality, and factory sustainability. Housing state-of-the-art facilities like the Alabama Initiative on Manufacturing Development and Education (Alabama IMaDE), UA provides a unique environment for generating training data, testing AI applications, and validating cutting-edge technologies, ensuring the center\u2019s impactful contributions to the manufacturing industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
