 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2025 Midwest Optimization Meeting (Recent Advances in Optimization, Control Theory, and Applications) will be the latest instance of an annual conference that began at Western Michigan University in 1997, and which for many years has provided a unique educational opportunity for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early-career faculty.  Optimization is one of the major branches of applied mathematics, and has significant applications in different parts of science and engineering.  The 2025 Midwest Optimization Meeting will feature plenary speakers who will review the most recent advances and trends in optimization, as well as recent applications to machine/deep learning and data science.  Conference support will allow graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early-career faculty to attend, to contribute talks, and to interact with leading researchers in this vast and rapidly expanding area of study.\r\nThematic areas of emphasis for the 2025 Midwest Optimization Meeting include non-smooth optimization, control theory, and computational mathematics and large-scale optimization.  Applications within these areas include optimization in data science, such as over-parameterization in deep learning, distributed federated learning, control theory in deep learning, stochastic optimization, parametric optimization, and statistical optimization.  Conference plenary speakers are experts in variational and convex analysis, optimization in machine learning/data science, and optimal control.  The conference website, with registration link, travel information, and conference schedule is at https://25midwestoptimization.vfairs.com/en/, and will be updated frequently in the time leading up to the event.  The event will be open to anyone interested in the conference themes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
