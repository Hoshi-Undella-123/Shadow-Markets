 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas Gulf Coast continues to face severe flooding, habitat loss, and rising emissions, posing increasing risks to human safety, economic stability, and environmental health. This project brings a novel, nature-inspired solution \u2013 the Living Engineered Reef System, designed to simultaneously protect shorelines, store carbon dioxide, and restore marine habitats vital for local economies and biodiversity. To overcome existing technological barriers, the project adopts an interdisciplinary, application-ready approach that integrates earth sciences, materials engineering, biological sciences, and data-driven tools such as artificial intelligence and remote sensing. By co-developing this solution with a broad network of community members and collaboratively assessing implementation challenges and economic feasibility, the project lays the groundwork for its immediate large-scale adoption. As the project advances, it will bring new income-generating opportunities, specialized training in science and technology, and above all greater technological competence against coastal resilience challenges. \r\n\r\nThis R2I2 project \u2013 the Living Engineered Reef System, offering a unique integration of three-fold benefits, namely, reduced coastal flood risks, oyster habitat (re)growth, and carbon storage, which the traditional reef restoration efforts are currently failing to deliver. Using an interdisciplinary approach grounded in coastal hydrology, materials engineering, and biological sciences, and harnessing advanced technologies such as additive manufacturing, artificial intelligence, and remote sensing, the project aims to evaluate the scalability and cost-effectiveness of this living reef system through a focused pilot study and stakeholder engagement. Specifically, in phase I, the project will identify practical implementation barriers, perform detailed techno-economic assessments, expand stakeholder engagement, and establish a robust co-design framework through community-driven workshops. The anticipated outcomes include technical guidelines for optimized design pathways and a comprehensive understanding of the reef system\u2019s efficacy, setting the stage for immediate and sustainable large-scale implementation in phase II. These objectives directly support NSF's mission to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare and secure national defense through enhanced coastal resilience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
