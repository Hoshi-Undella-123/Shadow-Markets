 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to improve a special type of chemical reaction that uses both plasma (an energized gas) and catalysts (materials that speed up reactions). Plasma can create very reactive particles that help transform tough chemicals, but it only affects a small part of the gas and most of the reactive particles disappear before reaching the catalyst. Current catalysts don\u2019t work well in these conditions, so this project will design new ones that are better suited for plasma systems. Researchers will use advanced lab experiments and computer models to study how plasma and catalysts interact. This could lead to useful applications like clean energy, water treatment, and medical sterilization. The project will also support student research and inspire younger students to explore science and technology.\r\n\r\nDespite years of continuous research on plasma-catalysis, there still exists a critical knowledge gap in understanding the complex dynamics of plasma-catalytic interfacial systems. In particular, there is a crucial need to seek new mechanisms to enhance and precisely control the synergistic interactions between catalytic surfaces and plasma intermediates. The goal of this project is, therefore, to explore a transformative approach to designing catalysts that are responsive to the electric field and are compatible with plasma systems. The significance of this research lies in enhancing the electric field close to the surface of the catalyst. Experiments and computational studies will be integrated to deeply investigate the influence of surface field and charge induced at the plasma-catalyst interface on the chemistry of plasma-generated intermediates. The underlying mechanisms governing the adsorption of active species under enhanced surface field and surface charge will also be elucidated to leverage the surface charge as a tool for engineering the reaction and enhancing the reaction selectivity at the molecular level. Ultimately, the fundamental understanding obtained will be used to develop a bi-functional catalyst for the highest possible rate of carbon dioxide and hydrogen conversion and selective production of oxygenates. The anticipated outcome of the project, rooted in fundamental understanding, includes establishing design guidelines for novel multifunctional catalysts with tunable properties for non-thermal plasmas, which can potentially promote a new research area in plasma-catalysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
