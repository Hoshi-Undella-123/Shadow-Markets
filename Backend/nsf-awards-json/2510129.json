 "awd_abstract_narration": "Massive stars are born in thick clouds of gas and dust. Within these environments, radio telescopes have revealed compounds known as \u201ccomplex organic molecules\u201d (COMs). These carbon-based molecules are precursors of larger molecules that are needed for life. Understanding how COMs form and evolve in space is key to uncovering the origin of complex chemical species on Earth and on planets orbiting other stars. Led by a team at the University of Virginia, this project combines cutting-edge astronomical observations and computational chemical simulations to investigate how and why the chemical content varies across different star-forming environments. This research will help astronomers to understand the chemistry of our galaxy and to trace the building blocks of life across the universe. In addition to expanding our knowledge of space chemistry, the project also focuses on training future scientists. It will support students at every level, from elementary school through graduate school, and increase learning opportunities for students with limited exposure to astronomy and space science. Public events will help bring science education and excitement to local communities.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the origin and evolution of space chemistry, particularly the disparities in chemical content observed between star-forming regions, requires a comprehensive study of a large sample of star-forming objects spanning a wide range of masses, ages, and environments. This project combines (i) multi-wavelength observations of molecules in massive star-forming regions with (ii) state-of-the-art simulations that provide a theoretical picture of the spatial distribution of molecules in such regions at different moments. From here, the team will build a detailed chemical evolutionary sequence for massive star formation, guided by observations that resolve molecular emission across various sources at different scales and evolutionary stages. Synthetic spectra and emission maps generated from the simulations will be directly compared with observational data to identify the chemical pathways leading to various important molecules and to determine how environmental factors shape the chemical content of new stars and planets. This project will directly inform the interpretation of data from radio-telescopes such as the NSF\u2019s ALMA and Green Bank Observatory (GBO).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
