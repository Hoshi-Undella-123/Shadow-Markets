 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on solving challenges in designing and improving optical resonators, which are essential components in technologies such as the internet, medical diagnostics, and advanced computing. Current methods for creating these resonators are slow and limited, which makes it hard to develop new and better devices. This project will make the design process faster and more efficient. This could lead to important breakthroughs, such as better systems for quantum communication, more accurate sensors for healthcare, and energy-efficient technologies for data processing. Additionally, the project will help prepare future engineers and scientists by involving students in cutting-edge research and creating collaborations with industries to address the shortage of skilled workers in technology and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe proposed framework leverages high-performance computing technologies to enable faster and larger-scale simulations. The research will explore and optimize novel resonator designs such as high-quality factor waveguide resonators, Moire photonic structures, and low-symmetry optical resonators. These efforts aim to advance both the theoretical understanding and practical applications of photonics, with potential uses in quantum light sources, optical computing systems, and next-generation sensors. The project also includes an educational initiative to increase participation in research and train skilled professionals for the semiconductor industry\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
