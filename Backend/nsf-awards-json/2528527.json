 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund about five U.S-based students' travel to the Security and Human Behavior (SHB) workshop to be held in June 2025. The goals of SHB are to discuss, in an informal and interdisciplinary setting, issues where security, psychology, and behavior interact. The topical scope is broad: topics that have been covered in the past include the misperception of risk, security usability, deception, and security and privacy decision making. The disciplinary scope is also broad, bringing together security researchers, psychologists, information scientists, economists, computer scientists, philosophers, law scholars, and others. The goal of the workshop is to develop individual researchers and a wider community that can address security issues with a deep understanding of social phenomena related to security decision-making and technologies.\r\n\r\nStudent attendees will greatly benefit from participating in the workshop, where they will interact with research leaders from a variety of disciplines and will be exposed to the most recent developments in information security and privacy research. In particular, the first rule of the SHB Workshop is that everyone who attends participates in the discussion. This will ensure that students are more involved and improve the benefits from attending SHB than many conferences and workshops where they can simply listen.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
