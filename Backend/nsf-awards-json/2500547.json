 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project Leeward Community College will broaden the academic scope of the associate in science degree in Mechatronics to include the first formal educational pathway in Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) offered in the State of Hawaii. The project will develop three courses and create two CIM laboratories to support the coursework at the main Leeward campus and Wai'anae-Moku Learning center. Over the three-year project 91 students enrolling in the mechatronics degree program will complete the CIM coursework, resulting in an associate's degree and certificate of achievement in CIM. Hawaii is not traditionally recognized as a major manufacturing hub, however, the state's workforce needs are rapidly evolving as small-scale manufacturing transitions from manual to automated systems. Additionally, the military and defense sectors, key contributors to Hawaii's economy, are experiencing significant growth due to the United States' strategic rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region. As a critical defense outpost and waypoint, Hawaii plays an essential role in the maintenance, repair, and readiness of military equipment and infrastructure. This growing reliance on automation and precision manufacturing across multiple industries underscores the importance of developing a skilled workforce capable of supporting these high-tech sectors and strengthening Hawaii's economic resilience. By incorporating three industry-aligned courses in CIM, with emphasis on hands-on experiential learning in computer aided design, manufacturing and Industry 4.0 technologies, the diversified mechatronics degree will better prepare students for emerging workforce demands in advanced manufacturing. \r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to build a robust, future-ready mechatronics degree program that includes coursework in CIM. By broadening the curriculum, and positioning CIM laboratories at both the Pearl City campus and Wai'anae-Moku Learning Center, the project will produce highly skilled technicians from a cross-section of the population, ready to contribute to Hawaii's economy and support critical sectors, including the military and emerging advanced manufacturing industries in the state. To support the curricula, two state-of-the-art CIM learning laboratories will be designed and constructed. The Pearl City campus laboratory will serve a broad population of students, while the Waianae-Moku Learning Center laboratory will expand access for Native Hawaiian and other communities on the Wai\u02bbanae coast of Oahu. Broader impacts include strengthening Hawaii's industrial base and supporting economic development. By training a pool of technicians and providing professional development for faculty, this project aligns with the National Science Foundation's mission to advance workforce readiness, broaden participation in STEM fields, and contribute to national security interests. Through strategic partnerships with local industry, defense facilities, and high schools, Leeward Community College will cultivate a skilled talent pipeline, ensuring that Hawaii's workforce remains competitive in the rapidly evolving field of advanced manufacturing.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation\u2019s economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
