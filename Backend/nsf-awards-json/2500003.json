 "awd_abstract_narration": "David A. Cagan is awarded an NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (NSF MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and activities related to broadening participation in STEM. This fellowship to Dr. Cagan supports the research project entitled \u201cPostdoctoral Fellowship: MPS-Ascend: Leveraging Marcus Theory for Selective Quaternary Carbon Formation in Rapid Alternating Polarity Electrolysis\u201d under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host institution for the fellowship is the Scripps Research Institute, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Phil S. Baran.\r\n\r\nThis proposal intends to develop electrochemical methods for transition-metal directed radical coupling reactions with the potential for minimizing the environmental impact of the fine chemicals\u2019 industry and lowering the cost of pharmaceuticals. The research will combine the radical selectivity of transition metal catalysis with the chemoselectivity of alternating current electrolysis to electrochemically form new C(sp3)\u2013C(sp3) quaternary centers and valuable heterocoupled products. Successful implementation of this work will provide fundamental insights into obtaining kinetic control over a homogeneous system of both organic and organometallic species. The proposed research will provide direct, environmentally conscious routes to medically relevant molecules and could lead to further technological development in the chemical applications of renewable energy and in advancing the field of medicinal chemistry.\r\n \r\nThe PI intends to mentor high school students through a summer internship opportunity in the host institution, and to host workshops to aid undergraduate students from a variety of backgrounds apply to graduate research programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
