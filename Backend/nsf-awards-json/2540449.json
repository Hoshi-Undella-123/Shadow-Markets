 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support US-based graduate student, postdoctoral and early career investigator attendance at the RNA Localization and Local Translation conference, to be held June 30 to July 4, 2026. The meeting will be administered by the European  Molecular Biology Organization and co-organized by Dorothy Lerit, Michael Kiebler, Matthew Taliaferro, and Edouard Bertrand. The format of the meeting is a combination of keynote presentations by leaders in the field, plus over 30 talks selected from submitted abstracts, 10 flash talks, and two poster sessions. Professional development programming is incorporated into the meeting agenda, designed to enhance interactions between trainees and established researchers. This meeting affords many opportunities (both formal and informal) for sharing recent research findings and exploring collaborations. \r\n\r\nThis is a unique biannual meeting focusing on RNA localization and regulation that began in 1994. Recent advances on how the spatial and often developmentally-programmed localization of RNA impacts cell development and function will be highlighted in this conference. The meeting focuses on RNA transport, translation, stability and decay, and how cells regulate protein expression. The conference primarily highlights unpublished research findings and provides many experiences for young researchers to learn about the field and devise future avenues for research. The meeting will bring together scientists from around the world, and encourage career development of a new generation of researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
