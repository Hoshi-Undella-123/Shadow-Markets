 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve early childhood literacy and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) engagement through a screen-free, interactive learning platform. Unlike traditional screen-based tools, this innovation integrates the tactile benefits of physical books with interactive, audio-guided literacy activities across STEM topic areas. Designed for children aged 3\u20138, the platform fosters independent learning, encourages curiosity, and reduces screen exposure. This approach addresses critical developmental concerns while promoting foundational skills in STEM and literacy. Initial adoption is expected among families and early education providers, with long-term scalability to schools and libraries. By year three, the platform is projected to have positively impacted thousands of children, offering a healthier and more effective learning experience that supports national educational priorities.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances a screen-free educational platform that combines physical books with embedded NFC technology, enabling interactive, curriculum-aligned STEM and literacy activities. Research objectives include refining the platform for classroom use, expanding content libraries to align with national educational standards, and conducting efficacy studies to measure learning outcomes and engagement. The project will employ real-world testing in classroom environments, incorporating feedback from educators and parents. Anticipated outcomes include a scalable, scientifically validated platform with proven benefits for early literacy and STEM education, establishing a new benchmark for innovative, developmentally appropriate learning tools for young children.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
