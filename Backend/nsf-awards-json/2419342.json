 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the potential to improve temperature-controlled storage and transportation across multiple sectors. This technology addresses the critical need for precise temperature control in storing and transporting temperature-sensitive medications, biologics, and other perishable components, particularly in scenarios where power is unavailable or unreliable. The commercial potential is vast, with markets ranging from individual consumers to healthcare providers to cold chain logistics companies. By reducing medication spoilage, this technology can decrease healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes, while also supporting disaster relief efforts by ensuring the viability of essential medical supplies during crises. Furthermore, this project can advance scientific understanding by enabling more accurate data collection and analysis related to the impact of temperature fluctuations on sensitive materials. Lastly, this technology could enable medication delivery to and storage in rural places where previously even if the medication had been delivered, the patients had no means of keeping it cold to continue their therapy.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on refining and optimizing a temperature control and insulation system that leverages thermoelectric coolers in combination with a vacuum flask. The key innovation involves decoupling the thermoelectric coolers from the cooled payload using a water block, minimizing energy use while maintaining precise temperature control. The research objectives include minimizing heat transfer to the payload by investigating new lid and flask designs and materials, miniaturizing the cooling assembly without sacrificing performance, and developing a minimum viable product that can sustain refrigeration temperatures for 24 hours or more, even in extreme conditions. The project also aims to integrate advanced features such as hot-swappable batteries, USB-C and solar charging, and wireless connectivity for monitoring and control. The anticipated outcome is a market-ready device that meets the needs of individual consumers, healthcare providers, and logistics companies, with the potential for broad commercial adoption and licensing opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
