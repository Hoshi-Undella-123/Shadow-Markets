 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of undergraduate students enrolled at HBCUs so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of this project is to implement curricular enhancement in chemistry by incorporating innovative course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) into chemistry courses while modernizing the forensic chemistry laboratory at Hampton University.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to accomplish this goal by 1) designing and implementing CUREs sequence for analytical and forensic chemistry courses; 2) revising the existing seminar course to incorporate topics that connect chemistry to real-life applications; and 3) developing a pilot forensics-themed activity for the second semester general chemistry laboratory. The proposed activities will provide students with foundational skill sets to solve real-life practical scenarios in forensic science while building technical skills to increase competitiveness for graduate education. The expected outcome of this project will generate new pedagogical knowledge about CUREs method development and trace analysis in analytical chemistry and forensic science alike. By equipping students with these advanced skills, the project has the potential to contribute best practices to support the expansion of the nation\u2019s skilled STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
