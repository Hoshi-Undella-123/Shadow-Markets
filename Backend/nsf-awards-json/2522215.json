 "awd_abstract_narration": "The human brain is fascinating as it can form multiple memories that allow us to remember different types of information like facts and events (e.g., Paris is the capital of France) and procedures (e.g., how to ride a bike). These types of memories are often studied independently, even though memories that are formed everyday combine information from different domains. For example, when one learns to play the piano, one not only learns the sequences of movements on the piano keyboard, but also the melody associated with the movements and the sequence of notes written on the music score. Although the content of these memories differs, their structure is similar. This research examines how learning different material with similar structures is carried out in the brain, whether it is more likely to form lasting memories, and also tests whether this property can be used to improve memory. If successful, this work has translational potential for developing new ways to enhance the formation of lasting memories. In addition, this project supports public engagement with science and includes workshops for K-12 students, as well as mentored research experiences in cognitive neuroscience and advanced data analysis for undergraduate trainees.\r\n\r\nThis project utilizes sequence learning as a study model as it underlies several daily activities in both memory domains (e.g., memory for sequences of events and actions). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is employed to delineate the brain responses supporting sequence learning across memory domains (motor sequence vs. object sequence learning), with a focus on a brain region critical for memory, namely the hippocampus. The project examines how these brain responses can be strengthened across domains to improve memory consolidation, which is the process by which memories become more stable and robust for the long-term. This research also uses electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activity during an important memory consolidation period, namely sleep. The goal is to experimentally reactivate memories from different domains during specific sleep periods and ultimately investigate whether memories from different domains that are learned together consolidate together. In addition to the potential translation to methods for improving memory consolidation, this project will increase our understanding of the principles underlying learning and memory consolidation in the human brain which may inspire advancements in artificial intelligence models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
