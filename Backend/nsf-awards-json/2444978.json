 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Evaluation and Analytics Capacity Hub (REACH) will provide a new national forum for the advancement of research analytics, the use of data-informed decision-making and artificial intelligence (AI), and responsible research assessment practices within the field of research administration. REACH leverages expertise from across the globe and engages institutions interested in building capacity in these areas to strengthen their research enterprise. Participants come from all types of institutions and from a variety of professional fields, including research administrators, researchers, and librarians.\r\n\r\nThe goal of REACH is to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in responsible data-informed approaches in the field of research administration. REACH builds on existing empirical research and communities of practice and will expand the understanding of how we utilize data-informed approaches to build research support workforce efficiency, research strategy, and research capacity. REACH activities will include the research analytics mentoring program RAMP and an annual in-person research analytics summit.  In addition, the network will maintain online resources and host a variety of webinars and training programs. The work of REACH is collaborative and involves the National Council of University Research Administrators and the Society of Research Administrators International as partners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
