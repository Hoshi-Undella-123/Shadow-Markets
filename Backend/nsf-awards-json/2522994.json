 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support participants of the Texas Undergraduate Mathematics Conference (TUMC) which will be hosted in fall 2025 at St Mary\u2019s University in San Antonio, TX and in fall 2026 at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, TX. The focus of this conference is research done by undergraduate students or in conjunction with undergraduates. This conference offers undergraduates the opportunity to interact with research being done by their peers and to begin their connection with the larger mathematical research community.\r\n\r\nNow in its 20th year, the Texas Undergraduate Mathematics Conference (TUMC) aims to provide students with a forum to present their work, to discover research opportunities, and to learn more about graduate school and non-academic careers in mathematics. TUMC serves many students from across Texas including those that have limited research opportunities such as those that attend community colleges and Emerging Research Institutions (ERIs). As part of this vital link between undergraduate students and the mathematical research community, TUMC will be run with minimal cost for undergraduate participants. This support is meant to increase participation from institutions with limited resources, such as community colleges. The Executive Committee for TUMC will also expand their efforts in collecting demographic information to include information about the research activities of student and faculty participants. In particular, they will investigate the ways in which the uptake of research activities occurs in the year after attending TUMC and how effective targeted funding for ERIs is at fostering continued engagement with the research community. Additional information about the conference can be found on the website: http://sections.maa.org/texas/tumc.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
