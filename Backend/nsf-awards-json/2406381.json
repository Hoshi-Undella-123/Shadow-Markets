 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create a new, advanced tool called Atlas2 to help scientists better understand minerals that make up the Earth. By studying these minerals under extreme conditions, we can learn more about our planet\u2019s structure and how it works. Atlas2 will make it easier to measure changes in minerals and improve our understanding of volcanos and earthquakes. The new tool will help researchers in many fields, from geology to engineering. It will also provide valuable educational opportunities for students. It will support collaborations across the country. Scientists will use Atlas2 to solve real-world problems related to mineral resources, environment, and national security.\r\n\r\nAtlas2 is an upgraded version of an existing advanced X-ray diffractometer, Atlas1. It will use new, stronger X-ray source to examine very small mineral samples in greater detail. The new system will be much better at detecting small mineral grains and will provide more accurate data. The improvements will enable study of minerals difficult to analyze and will allow for more precise experiments. Atlas2 will also include software that automatically collects and analyzes data, making it easier and more reliable to use. This tool will help make important discoveries in mineral science and will encourage collaborations with other scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
