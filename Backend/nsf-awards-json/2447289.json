 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research experiences for undergraduates\u2019 site will provide 30 undergraduate students with opportunities to conduct research in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence in the context of the Internet of Things. Participants will conduct research with faculty serving as mentors at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) for 9 weeks and they will take part in professional development activities to expand their perspectives and prepare them for future careers in computer science, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. The REU experiences will develop participants\u2019 skills to secure the U.S. cyberspace, advance the knowledge and application of artificial intelligence, and develop a strong U.S. workforce. The project will recruit 10 participants (U.S. citizens/U.S. residents) per year and will increase the participation in research in computer science, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. \r\n\r\nThe REU projects will research the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in IoT systems, and develop new methods, models and tools to secure them. With the projected growth and pervasiveness of IoT systems in areas such as healthcare, public infrastructure, agriculture, entertainment, and U.S. national defense, the proposed projects will improve the security in these systems by collecting and analyzing data, and developing new algorithms and protocols applying Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in issues related to the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of data on the Internet of Things. The project and hands-on REU experiences and professional development activities (such as workshops in cybersecurity, AI/ML, research ethics, graduate school applications, among others) will enable participants to develop skills for their careers and will provide opportunities to gain knowledge about graduate schools degrees and research careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
