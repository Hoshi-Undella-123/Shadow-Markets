 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will convene a conference to improve the preparation of early career engineering faculty by identifying and sharing responsible authorship and publication practices.  A guiding theme of the conference is how to advise engineering faculty on navigating challenges, such as the use of artificial intelligence, associated with authorship and publication. The project team aims to recruit engineering faculty, administrators, and other stakeholders from small to medium-sized academic organizations with emerging research programs to participate at the conference.\r\n\r\nThe project brings together a variety of stakeholders in the engineering community to accomplish two main goals. The first goal is to identify challenges and opportunities for early career engineering researchers pertaining to responsible authorship and publishing practices. The second goal is to develop effective training materials for faculty on authorship and publishing practices. The project focuses on challenges and priorities related to topics such as preventing research misconduct and detrimental research practices; responsible authorship practices; effective mentorship; the use of artificial intelligence in publishing; and identifying reputable publication venues. Project deliverables include open access online training and educational resources for engineering faculty.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
