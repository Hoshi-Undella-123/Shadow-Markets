 "awd_abstract_narration": "With a strong institutional track record in NSF\u2019s Scholarship for Service (SFS) program for preparing students for public service careers in AI and cybersecurity, Dakota State University (DSU) is uniquely positioned to continue contributing to national and global STEM workforce competitiveness. Through full scholarships, mentoring, internships, and career-placement support, the project will produce qualified professionals capable of implementing AI to enhance NSF\u2019s mission to promote the progress of science and secure the national defense.  The K-12 activities will help high school students and teachers gain cybersecurity and AI knowledge and skills.  This award also includes capacity building activities which will help to develop the workforce in AI areas that will benefit AI education at undergraduate and graduate levels at institutions of higher education (IHEs).  \r\n\r\nStudents selected for the program will receive scholarships while completing the required AI curriculum. They will participate in a robust support structure that includes mentoring, advising, internships, and regular cohort activities. Program enhancements reflect the evolving national priorities related to AI and Cyber. All recipients will participate in one of DSU\u2019s undergraduate or graduate AI programs or minors. Scholars will benefit from applied research experiences, dedicated facilities, and ongoing faculty mentorship. DSU will continue to collaborate with government partners, including the National Security Agency (NSA), Department of Energy (DoE) laboratories, Department of Defense (DoD), and state agencies to help scholars secure educational internships and pursue career opportunities that align with national priorities.  \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.  This project is also jointly funded by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
