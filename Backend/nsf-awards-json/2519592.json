 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of flood sensor technology that can be used to measure street-level flooding and provide actionable data to municipalities in real time. Flooding is a significant problem that requires data-driven interventions to mitigate its impact on urban areas. However, quantitative data on flood frequency, depth, and duration that are required for real-time response as well as the design of flood mitigation programs are not available in most municipalities across the United States. This flood sensor technology was developed to address this data gap and support the design of interventions for flood resilience, emergency planning, and response. The technology has the potential for large-scale societal impact, by providing hyper-local, real-time flood data to city agencies to optimize emergency response and infrastructure planning, ultimately mitigating the risks of property damage and loss of life. In addition, the technology is designed to make flood data accessible to residents, enhancing public awareness and preparedness related to floods. A pilot test of the system is currently underway in New York City, and the model could be scaled to flood-prone cities globally.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of an urban flood monitoring system. This is a sensor-based technology with supporting network infrastructure and real-time data processing pipelines that ensure the timely delivery of actionable flood event data. The solution is designed specifically for measuring flood frequency, depth, and duration in complex urban environments and includes: low-cost flood sensors that measure street-level flood depth at high resolution without requiring existing power or network infrastructure; cellular network integration, for transmission of data from sensors to servers in real time; artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data pipelines to process raw telemetry into actionable insights for stakeholders; and a suite of data services, including real-time flood data dashboards with time-series and map-based visualizations. A current pilot project consisting of over 250 flood sensors deployed in New York City has demonstrated an interest in the use of the technology by city agencies and residents. Results show that city agencies, including those responsible for emergency services, flood mitigation, transportation, and housing, require flood data for public safety and infrastructure design and planning applications. This model system may offer a replicable framework for other flood-prone cities to combat challenges posed by flooding.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
