 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to serve the national interest by addressing student retention and success at a two-year college through the development of a multidisciplinary network of course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) in introductory STEM courses. In collaboration with community partners, Delgado Community College seeks to engage students in authentic, place-based research projects that introduce STEM research early in their academic journey and support transitions to four-year institutions or the workforce. Students contribute to their communities by investigating research questions along the Lafayette Greenway, a field location in New Orleans, Louisiana. By embedding research opportunities in early course work, the project fosters technical skill development and responds to the national demand for a skilled STEM workforce. As part of a broader movement to expand early research experiences, this effort offers a replicable model for other two-year colleges.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to: 1) improve student success and retention in STEM by embedding CUREs into STEM pathways, 2) foster a learning context that promotes students' development as scientists, and 3) build relationships with community partners to support students' transition to four-year institutions. To meet these goals, the project creates a multidisciplinary network of research experiences integrated into courses such as biology, chemistry, and geology. Faculty from across STEM disciplines in collaboration with partners from academia, nonprofits, and industry will design research experiences and implement innovative instructional practices using data from the Greenway. A mixed-methods approach examines the impact of the intervention on faculty professional growth, as well as on students STEM knowledge, interest, and educational aspirations. Dissemination includes student and faculty presentations and publications in relevant journals. By integrating place-based research with evidenced-based teaching practices, the initiative positions two-year colleges as key contributors to advancing innovation in STEM education. The NSF IUSE: Innovation in Two-Year College STEM Education (ITYC) Program seeks to accelerate the impact of and advance knowledge about emerging and evidence-based practices in undergraduate STEM education at two-year colleges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
