 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract: The Fundamentals of Quantum Materials (FQM) Winter School and Workshop is a nationally recognized activity that provides essential education and training in the rapidly growing field of quantum materials. Hosted by the University of Maryland since 2017, this annual event brings together undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and leading scientists for an immersive experience in both theory and hands-on practices. The event aims to develop the next generation of quantum science researchers by combining morning lectures on pedagogical background, lab-based hands-on training sessions, and networking opportunities to address topics at the forefront of current research into quantum materials. The program fosters connections across disciplines\u2014spanning physics, chemistry, and materials science\u2014and strengthens the national research infrastructure in quantum materials. Its strong emphasis on mentorship and public engagement plays a vital role in maintaining U.S. leadership in quantum research and workforce development.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: This activity developed out of a mandate to educate junior quantum scientists in the synthesis, characterization, and theoretical modeling of quantum materials. The annual program involves a week-long school focused on providing foundational training in bulk single-crystal and thin-film materials synthesis, characterization and fundamental exploration techniques based on a focused theme that ties to current thrusts in the quantum materials community - including topics ranging from superconductivity to magnetism to correlated electron physics. Pedagogical lectures on topics ranging from basic crystal growth techniques to more specialized approaches are provided by ten or more of the nation's top practicing quantum materials scientists, and laboratory sessions are organized and conducted at the University of Maryland\u2019s Quantum Materials Center, which offers participants direct exposure to cutting-edge experimental tools and techniques. The structure of the school includes mornings of lectures and tutorials, with afternoons devoted to practical demonstrations in laboratories in the Quantum Material Center. The school also includes a visit to a local scientific facility, a poster session attended by senior scientists, and a one-day workshop where all school attendees participate in top-level research presentations by experts in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
