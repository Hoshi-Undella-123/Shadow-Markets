 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIMS-CRM Summer School 2025 will be a great opportunity for graduate students and junior researchers from the US to learn about some of the most active research areas in probability from top experts in the field. The PIMS summer schools in probability theory were launched in 2004, and this will be the 10th school. These summer schools have made an impressive name for themselves and have a proven track record of fostering long-term collaborations between the participants. Past participants have become current academic faculty, able to spread their knowledge further in the research community.\r\n\r\nThe participants will learn the current techniques in cutting-edge areas of probability.  It is expected that the participants will engage in active research on some topics covered by the main courses and related areas, and many will give presentations on their current research. The expansive scope of the school (4 weeks, about 100 participants) has academic significance: the courses are able to go into much greater detail than courses in shorter summer schools, and participants are much more likely to form new collaborations. The summer school website is https://secure.math.ubc.ca/Links/ssprob25/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
