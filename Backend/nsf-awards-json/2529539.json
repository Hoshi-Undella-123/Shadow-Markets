 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Workshop on Combinatorial Algorithms (IWOCA) is a premier international conference on combinatorial algorithms, which study many basic objects with applications in optimization, health and cybersecurity areas. These topics meet the national interests of the United States in terms of advancing national health, prosperity, and cybersecurity. \r\n\r\nThe 36th version of IWOCA is to be held in Bozeman, Montana in July 2025. This project provides support for twenty US-based students to attend this conference. These students will be exposed to the most recent developments in algorithmic processing of combinatorial objects involving strings (with applications in computational biology and health-related areas) and graphs (with applications in industrial optimization and cybersecurity), etc. The experience will contribute to the development of these students as they become capable professionals in STEM areas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
