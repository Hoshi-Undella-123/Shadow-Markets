 "awd_abstract_narration": "Urban streams are \"\ufb02ashy,\" and have rapid \ufb02uctuations in water levels, leading to frequent \ufb02ooding and pollution in urban areas. By mimicking the functions of natural beaver dams, beaver dam analogs (BDAs) o\ufb00er a sustainable alternative to conventional, often costly, stormwater systems. BDAs may enhance the ecological resilience of urban streams by improving their ability to withstand and recover from adverse e\ufb00ects such as \ufb02ooding and pollution. This project, based at Susquehanna University\u2019s \ufb01eld station, evaluates newly constructed BDAs and their e\ufb03cacy in improving the health and management of urban streams overwhelmed by stormwater. The outcomes will inform whether adoption of low-cost, low-tech, process-based BDA restoration methods is e\ufb00ective in controlling stormwater. By evaluating e\ufb00ectiveness of BDAs, the study will support decision making about the broader adoption of BDAs by city planners and policymakers as a new approach to urban stream management.\r\n\r\nThrough \ufb01eld-based investigations at an on-campus demonstration site, this project will determine how BDAs can stabilize \ufb02ashy urban streams and improve their capacity to absorb and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events such as storms, droughts, and \ufb02oods, as well as other urban stressors. Detailed monitoring of changes in water \ufb02ow, retention, and quality will be used to assess the e\ufb00ectiveness of BDAs. The project will also evaluate the cost-e\ufb00ectiveness and ecological bene\ufb01ts of BDAs in comparison to traditional stormwater management solutions like concrete channels and culverts, which are typically more expensive and o\ufb00er limited bene\ufb01ts for ecological health and stormwater management. BDAs may demonstrate signi\ufb01cant economic and environmental advantages. Furthermore, this project will broaden its reach beyond academic research by partnering with local organizations to provide BDA-focused educational programming. This will enhance community involvement and promote sustainable stormwater management practices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
