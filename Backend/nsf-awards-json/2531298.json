 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to safely recycle materials from scrap cathodes generated in manufacturing facilities of lithium-ion batteries. This proposed innovation could lead to numerous socioeconomic benefits, such as creating new jobs, reducing the need for extraction of rare elements from mines, e.g. lithium, improving national security by decreasing reliance on imported battery materials, and decreasing the battery cost for electric vehicles and for renewable energy storage. In terms of broader educational outcomes, several graduate and undergraduate students will be directly trained in developing new technologies. Students will also learn about technology translation and entrepreneurship. Additionally, through summer camps offered in this project, STEM students will benefit from the leadership and entrepreneurship training, which will ultimately better prepare the STEM workforce to ultimately enhance and contribute to the U.S. technology-based economy. This project has the potential to enhance scientific and technological understanding of recycling energy materials while simultaneously contributing to a sustainable and environmentally friendly industry.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project aims to address the unique challenges associated with the direct recycling of cathode active materials from lithium-ion battery manufacturing scrap, with the goal of returning the recycled materials to the supply chain. The project seeks to overcome two major technological hurdles. First, the project aims to achieve a formulation for solvent blends for different cathode active materials while considering solubility, toxicity, safety, recoverability, and cost constraints. Second, the project aims to demonstrate the performance of the scrap recycling machine, which will involve two discrete steps: \"process and method identification\" and \"machine assembly, testing, and proof-of-concept demonstration.\" It is estimated that this machine can save 10-15% of the cathode material consumption of lithium-ion battery manufacturing facilities, thereby reducing the cost of domestic lithium-ion battery manufacturing by 4-6%. Through this project, the research team will advance the fundamental knowledge of polymer solvent blending formulation and explore the effect of the blend on possible damages to cathode active materials, as well as the recoverability, safety, and environmental impacts of the solvent.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
