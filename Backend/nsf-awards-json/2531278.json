 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 2025 edition of the West Coast Operator Algebras Symposium (WCOAS), to be held at Pomona College in Claremont, CA December 6-7, 2025.  The field of operator algebras began with the work of Murray and von Neumann as a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics and has since grown into an established subfield of mathematical analysis, with applications and connections to many areas of mathematical sciences.  This year\u2019s conference will showcase current trends in operator algebra theory and applications to other fields, including ergodic theory, number theory, representation theory, and mathematical physics.  The conference schedule will feature plenary talks by leading researchers and early-career mathematicians, as well as numerous opportunities for discussion and networking. More information can be found on the conference website https://aguilar.sites.pomona.edu/wcoas25/wcoas25.html.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike previous editions of the conference series, WCOAS 2025 will contribute to sustaining vigorous research activity in operator theory and operator algebras, and their applications to other fields.  Plenary speakers will survey recent advances and current trends, enabling participants to keep abreast of recent developments in a vast and rapidly expanding subject.  In addition to leading researchers and veteran participants, the conference organizers will invite graduate students, postdocs, and pre-tenure faculty members to participate to help showcase new people in the field, and to foster professional networking and collaboration across career stages.  Mathematical themes will touch on core topics in C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras, and noncommutative geometry, as well as connections to mathematical physics, ring theory, category theory, model theory, quantum topology, and quantum information theory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
