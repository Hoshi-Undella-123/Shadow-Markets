 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum simulation of many-body systems is a research area with important applications, from quantum information storage to the development of novel materials. This project will use ultra-cold sodium atoms to experimentally simulate complex quantum systems. The principal investigator (PI) and co-workers will explore applications of this simulator in quantum information science and quantum sensing. Additionally, the PI will integrate research and teaching by involving undergraduate and graduate students in research projects that will prepare students for a career in science and technology. The PI will also organize workshops for local high-school students to get hands-on experience with state-of-the-art quantum physics experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award supports experimental quantum physics studies in a programmable spinor quantum simulator consisting of sodium spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. The proposed studies include investigating ergodicity breaking and novel nonequilibrium spin dynamics, realizing and characterizing quantum scars in a many-body system, generating massive entanglement, and exploring promising applications in quantum information science. This proposal thus provides an exciting opportunity to investigate nonequilibrium dynamics, ergodicity breaking, quantum scars, and the interplay of superfluidity, strong correlations, and quantum magnetism.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
