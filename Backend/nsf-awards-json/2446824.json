 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program provides a ten-week summer research experience targeted at undergraduate students seeking in-depth and hands-on research in labs devoted to a wide range of topics connected with the theme of the Interconnected Mind. The site\u2019s goal is both to support the participating students in developing their careers and to work towards a better future for cognitive science. The experience is designed to provide students with broader knowledge of the field, important technical and professional skills, and connections to faculty and labs at the forefront of research. The ultimate objective is to help prepare the next generation of US scientists for continued research in important areas of national interest related to the nature of human intelligence and behavior (e.g., mapping the mind, understanding consciousness, understanding the bases of cooperation, developing industries in artificial intelligence and neurotechnology, and translating basic science to help people with cognitive and neurological diseases).\r\n\r\nThe program begins with an introductory workshop, followed by direct involvement in a research project in an established lab, and closes with a series of student project presentations. Throughout the program, the site will also hold journal club meetings, faculty research seminars, and professional development workshops. In their lab projects, student research will focus on different aspects of how the human mind works, integrating insights from multiple disciplinary approaches, such as neurobiology, psychology, linguistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. This site thus provides an integrated research, learning, and mentoring opportunity that introduces students to both the breadth (via programmed activities) and depth (via individual projects) of the field. The site seeks to help students see themselves as active contributors to a larger endeavor of understanding the nature of human minds and behavior. Students will get involved in conducting actual research on scientific questions supported by mentors drawn from a pool of faculty; and they will have the opportunity to explore interdisciplinary perspectives in cognitive science in a collaborative and supportive environment. Programming is designed according to evidence-based teaching and learning principles, and the research experience involves extensive scaffolding through mentorship, support, professional development and skills training. The site thereby aims to ensure that students have a positive experience that increases both their interest in and ability to continue in research careers and compete for admission to graduate programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
