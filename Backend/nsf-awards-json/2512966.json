 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum computers and simulators offer a powerful new approach to exploring the behavior of complex physical systems, from exotic materials to fundamental interactions in nature. However, many of the most important models in physics cannot be studied with today's quantum hardware, which is limited in the types of interactions it can natively implement. This project addresses that limitation by developing a new method that combines two core modes of quantum computing: digital gate operations and analog evolution, into a hybrid approach within a single experiment. By enabling new classes of interactions that are currently inaccessible, this work expands the scientific reach of quantum simulators and enhances their ability to address open questions in condensed matter and high-energy physics. The project also contributes to the progress of science by training graduate and undergraduate students in advanced quantum technologies, helping build a skilled workforce aligned with national priorities in quantum science and engineering.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the project seeks to realize effective quantum Hamiltonians involving higher-order spin interactions by interleaving a relatively small number of entangling digital gates with analog Hamiltonian evolution. This hybrid digital-analog technique avoids the approximation errors that limit purely digital simulations and may significantly broaden the class of quantum models that can be implemented experimentally. Using trapped-ion quantum processors, the research will demonstrate programmable many-body Hamiltonians containing three- and four-body interaction terms. A complementary theoretical effort will identify the full range of Hamiltonians accessible with this approach and assess its applicability to other quantum computing platforms. By extending the boundaries of what can be simulated with quantum hardware, this project lays the foundation for more powerful and versatile quantum simulators capable of addressing fundamental challenges across multiple areas of physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
