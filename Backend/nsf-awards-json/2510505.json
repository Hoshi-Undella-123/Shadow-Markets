 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of undergraduate students enrolled at HBCUs so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. This project will contribute to the national needs by diversifying and expanding the STEM workforce and strengthening U.S. innovation and competitiveness by addressing critical data science and bioinformatics skill gaps essential to public health, economic growth, and national resilience. With the rapid advancement of technologies across STEM fields, including natural sciences, biomedicine, and public health, these disciplines have become increasingly data-intensive. However, many undergraduate STEM programs lack integrated training in bioinformatics and data science, leaving students underprepared for a data-driven workforce. To address this gap, Johnson C. Smith University (JCSU will establish The DataSmiths Initiative, a comprehensive year-long program designed to immerse underserved STEM undergraduates in analytical and computational methods. Through a combination of seminar series, hands-on boot camps, structured peer mentorship, and data-intensive research experiences, students will develop the skills and confidence needed for success in graduate study and competitive STEM careers. The program emphasizes experiential learning and professional development to ensure that students not only master technical content but also build a strong STEM identity.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project include: (1) Strengthening the integration of analytical and computational approaches in JCSU\u2019s STEM curriculum; (2) Preparing students for advanced degrees and data-intensive careers through hands-on learning and mentored research; (3) Empower faculty through training to incorporate data science and bioinformatics practices into the curriculum; and (4) Establishing sustainable research and teaching partnerships with external institutions with data science expertise. Unlike a standalone course or single research experience, this initiative provides students with a structured and sustained learning experience across three semesters. Participants will engage in interdisciplinary collaborations, gain practical skills through research, and be supported through peer mentorship.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
