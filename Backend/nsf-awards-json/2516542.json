 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SECTION: \r\n\r\nPolymer nanocomposites, which are comprised of mixtures of inorganic nanomaterials (e.g. silica, clay etc.) dispersed in a polymer matrix. are used extensively innumerous applications, from automotives to advanced aerospace materials. Designing polymer nanocomposite materials with tailored properties is a major bottleneck, since inorganics and polymeric materials do not naturally mix, rather they tend to separate. While researchers have tried to address this issue by adjusting how polymers interact with inorganic nanomaterials, we chemically attach (graft) polymers to the individual nanoparticles to create molecular polymer grafted nanoparticles which guarantees their dispersion in a polymer matrix. This attachment is done to create new types of molecularly dispersed nanomaterials that offer unique combinations of properties that cannot be achieved with polymers or nanoparticles alone, or by simply blending the two. Tethering polymers to nanoparticles allows scientists to precisely control how these hybrid building blocks organize and behave, but it also changes the way the materials mix, often in unpredictable ways. This research explores how polymer\u2013nanoparticle attachment alters the balance of molecular forces that determine their mixing. Through systematic study of the size, structure and composition of these systems, the project seeks to explore the mixing rules (phase-behavior) in complex molecular nanocomposites. The work engages undergraduate and high school students in hands-on scientific research of these materials, providing both valuable early experience in nanoscale science and long-term American workforce development.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SECTION: \r\n\r\nThis study aims to understand the thermodynamics and kinetics of phase separation in binary blends of polymer-grafted nanoparticles (PGNPs), specifically poly(methyl methacrylate)-grafted and poly(styrene-acrylonitrile)-grafted silica nanoparticles. The project seeks to understand how tethering polymer chains to nanoparticle cores alters entropic contributions to mixing, potentially offsetting the enthalpic interactions that typically dominate in polymer blends. Three specific aims are pursued: (1) identifying entropy-dominated phase boundaries by tuning core size, grafting density, and chain lengths; (2) linking phase behavior to mechanical properties in thin films under confinement; and (3) studying entropic partitioning effects in nanopatterned films through imprinting and relaxation. The research specifically investigates entropy-enthalpy compensation effects, where a gain in entropy is offset by a loss in enthalpy (or vice versa), during pattern relaxation. It utilizes low volatility ionic liquids to enhance PGNP mobility and temporal pattern fidelity. Overall, this work aims to develop predictive models for phase behavior and mechanical properties in PGNP/PGNP blends, providing a foundation for molecular functional nanocomposite design. The project\u2019s broader aims support NSF\u2019s mission to promote scientific progress in the United States by integrating the research with hands-on, high-impact research opportunities for undergraduate and high school students. By cultivating scientific and technical skills in emerging young researchers, the project strengthens the United States\u2019 science and engineering workforce and contributes to maintaining America\u2019s leadership in materials science and nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
