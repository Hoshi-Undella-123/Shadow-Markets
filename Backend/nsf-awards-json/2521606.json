 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mosquitoes transmit diseases, including malaria and dengue fever, to people worldwide. Progress to reduce mosquito-borne diseases like malaria has faltered due to the ineffectiveness of current mosquito control techniques, which are predominantly insecticide-based. Anopheles stephensi is a highly effective mosquito vector of malaria.  It originally was native to South Asia and the Arabian Peninsula. Its range now expands to Africa, raising a concern that this mosquito will increase urban malaria transmission. Thus, novel control strategies are urgently required. One biocontrol agent that shows promise against the Aedes mosquito, a vector for dengue virus, is a bacterium called Wolbachia. A similar strategy\u2014to use Wolbachia as a control agent for Anopheles mosquitos\u2014offers a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable approach to reducing the burden of malaria. However, previous efforts to develop Wolbachia-based control methods for malaria have been unsuccessful. This team created two stable Wolbachia-infected Anopheles stephensi lines using a Wolbachia strains from Aedes and Culex mosquitoes. This team also identified native Wolbachia strains in two Anopheles mosquito species. Finally, this team shows that the mosquito microbiome impedes Wolbachia vertical transmission (from female to offspring) in Anopheles. With this knowledge and resources, the researchers will explore how mosquito genetics, the gut microbiome, and the environment affect the ability of different Wolbachia strains to control Anopheles mosquitos\u2019 ability to transmit malaria. This research will have an impact on our understanding of mosquito control, which will benefit human health of Americans at home and abroad and has the potential to generate future biotechnology innovations.   \r\n\r\nThis project examines (1) how host genetic background alters Wolbachia\u00ad mediated phenotypes essential for malaria control by exploiting wAlbB and wPip strains in stable symbioses in Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi; (2) vertical transmission of the gut microbiome in Wolbachia- infected and -uninfected Anopheles to determine specific bacterial interactions, thus allowing gut microbes to be deployed in synergy with Wolbachia to enhance mosquito control; (3) factors that facilitate establishment of Wolbachia infection of Anopheles, examining how host and/or bacterial adaptation to the symbiosis facilitates transinfection; and (4) how temperature alters Wolbachia strains' ability to invade populations and exploit the plasticity in Wolbachia density to select for heat-tolerant Wolbachia strain variants in Anopheles. Interspecies transfer of Wolbachia is successful in several mosquito species. Unfortunately, this success was achieved largely through trial and error. This project instead examines factors that enhance transfer success. By addressing these fundamental questions, this research lays the foundation to develop biotechnology that can control malaria and other human diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. This research has the potential to transform malaria vector control strategies by providing safer, more effective, and sustainable solutions to combat malaria worldwide. This award is made possible through the NSF-UKRI lead agency opportunity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
