 "awd_abstract_narration": "Space infrastructure plays a critical role in socio-economic development-enabling scientific discoveries and advancing communications, remote sensing, geophysical and astrophysical applications. The exponential growth in the launch of space objects in orbits around the Earth over the last few years has made space more congested and has contributed to increased space debris. Additionally, the increased government and commercial interest in lunar and Mars missions pose both potential benefits and risks to safe and sustainable space operations. The primary goal of the Center for Research in Emerging Sustainable Space Technologies (CRES2T), a partnership between the Pennsylvania State University, Texas A&M University, and Purdue University, is to research novel concepts and associated technologies that enable safe and responsible use of space for humanity. CRES2T researchers will investigate the intricate relationship between hardware and software design, autonomy, artificial intelligence, and modeling and simulation to enable safe in-space assembly, service and manufacturing (ISAM) while addressing the unique challenges posed by the harsh space environment. The secondary goal of this center is to stimulate and train the next-generation workforce in this critical area of national need. CRES2T activities have the potential to impact the new global space economy, create new jobs, and advance our nation\u2019s economic, scientific, technological, and national security interests. \r\n\r\nThe CRES2T activities will focus on an ecosystem where researchers not only conduct research and development of individual technologies related to space operations but also focus on integrating different technological advances in a seamless manner to accelerate transitioning of these advances to commercial entities. The research thrusts and the operation of CRES2T are formulated to address the complex and rapid commercial pulls involved in developing space technology. The Texas Space Commission has made significant investments in the state of Texas with the aim of catalyzing commercial investments and maintaining the state\u2019s leadership in advancing the space economy. Developed using the state investments, the Texas A&M Space Institute will provide an invaluable test facility and emulation testbeds for human and robotic space missions and associated technologies of the future. The Texas A&M site will examine the role of robotic systems in enabling sustainable space operations. It will work closely with other sites (Penn State and Purdue) to test these technologies in a seamless manner and developing the US operational workforce through student internships, annual workshops, short courses, and virtual tutorials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
