 "awd_abstract_narration": "Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, located on the Texas Gulf Coast and a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved site for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), will continue to offer a ten-week summer research experience in UAS technology to ten undergraduate students each year. Students are selected through a nationwide recruitment process aimed at attracting highly talented undergraduate students in computing or related disciplines. This unique research experience exposes undergraduate researchers to a wide range of UAS applications, addressing regional and national challenges such as coastal management, coastal ecology, human safety, precision agriculture, and UAS technology security. The program includes mentoring by experienced faculty, skill-building seminars and workshops, research presentations, graduate school preparation, and other professional development activities.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the program is to provide participants with valuable research experiences in a dynamic environment focused on the development of secure, autonomous UAS technology. Activities include research in applied computing for UAS-based applications, along with skill-building sessions designed to enhance group cohesiveness and refine technical writing, communication, and research skills. Research is concentrated in areas such as autonomous UAS, UAS security, and the use of unmanned systems across various fields. Participants will write and submit research papers on their work for presentation at local, regional, and national symposiums. Through the program, participants will explore opportunities for UAS technology in commercial, civilian, and governmental sectors, gain confidence in research, become motivated to pursue advanced degrees, and develop a passion for lifelong learning in computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
