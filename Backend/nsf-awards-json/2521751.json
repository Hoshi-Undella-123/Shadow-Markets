 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fossil record has provided numerous insights about early hominin lineage. Through field research and laboratory analyses this study reconstructs the environmental conditions under which ape and hominin lineages diverged. To develop a refined perspective of the landscapes and environments that led up to and followed this divergence, this study collects fossil vertebrates, establishes a complete chronology, analyzes paleo-environmental proxies, as well as spatial information. AI-generated algorithms are used to analyze spatial data, and biotechnology methods are applied in the analyses of stable isotopes. The study\u2019s approach significantly contributes to current scientific knowledge of ape and hominin evolution, provides field and laboratory training for students, and develops outreach activities that enhance public education. \r\n\r\nTo reconstruct the conditions under which the ape and hominin lineages diverged, this study conducts systematic analyses of faunal collections, phytolith, pollen, and n-alkane. The study analyzes and interprets sedimentary rock formations and integrates spatial information using AI generated algorithms. The study also develops a detailed chronostratigraphy that refines current knowledge. Fossil herbivore dentition is examined through microwear and other biotechnology methods (stable isotopes). Together these approaches provide a detailed environmental reconstruction that advances understanding of the selective forces that led to the emergence of the hominin lineage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
