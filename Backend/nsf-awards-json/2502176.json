 "awd_abstract_narration": "The RET Site: Photonic Microchip Fabrication Experiences for Oklahoma Educators seeks to address the critical workforce needs in STEM fields by immersing eight high school and community college educators each year in a six-week research program focused on photonic microchip fabrication. By providing hands-on experience and foundational knowledge in microelectronic fabrication and photonics, the program will empower educators to develop curricula that will enhance STEM education and broaden participation in semiconductor-related fields. Through strategic recruitment and statewide collaboration, participants will engage in innovative research projects and professional development activities. By integrating cutting-edge research into classroom instruction, educators will be better prepared to inspire the next generation for high-tech careers, supporting the U.S. semiconductor industry, strengthening Oklahoma\u2019s economy, and promoting national technological competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe primary objectives are to provide educators with hands-on experience in terahertz microchip fabrication and characterization at next-generation communication bands; enhance teachers' understanding of microelectronic fabrication and terahertz photonics; and develop curricula that integrate these research experiences into appropriate classroom instruction and lessons. Participating educators and their students will have access to on-campus Cleanroom facilities, where they will design and fabricate microchips, gaining practical skills in semiconductor processing. The program will also introduce terahertz photonics as an emerging field, enriching science education and fostering student engagement. Additionally, educators will develop pedagogical modules to make semiconductor education more accessible to all students. This kind of partnership between OSU and educators will lay the groundwork for sustainable semiconductor education initiatives that contribute to workforce development and technological advancement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
