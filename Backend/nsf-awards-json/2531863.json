 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to support the effort in deepening and expanding research alliance on complex cyber-physical infrastructure systems. More specifically, the project conducts two workshops on the topic of enhancing resilience of cyber-physical infrastructure systems in the era of AI. The workshops focus on just-in-time resilience innovations that can be flexibly implemented with available resources. They aim to generate new perspectives toward resilience; new concepts on future models and tools powering infrastructure design, development, and operation; and new market mechanisms capturing hidden capacity within existing assets.\r\n\r\nResearch alliance promotes science, and advances health, prosperity and welfare. By collaborating with Singapore and other allies, the US is well positioned to leverage technologies that have been already developed and tested or are emerging. The workshops are organized around four themes: 1) adaptive capacity of real-world systems; 2) optimizing demand forecasting and service provision; 3) urban designs in an uncertain time; and 4) resilience of the people. Novel real-world case studies are showcased while project ideas and mini proposals are prepared. In addition, workshop outputs form the roadmap for informing future joint funding opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
