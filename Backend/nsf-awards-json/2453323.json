 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the development of advanced computational methods for tracking and analyzing evolving patterns in large\u2011scale networks. Patterns of connections among entities, known as subgraphs, underpin insights in domains such as social interactions, biological processes, financial transactions, and communication systems. Real\u2011time analysis of how these patterns form and dissolve can enable early detection of disease outbreaks, improved understanding of social dynamics, and enhanced network security. By creating scalable and accessible tools for dynamic network analysis, this project will advance the national interest in data\u2011driven discovery across science, technology, and public welfare.\r\n\r\nThe project will pursue three integrated research thrusts. First, it will develop novel algorithms with provable efficiency guarantees for counting and enumerating subgraphs in the batch\u2011dynamic model on parallel and distributed systems. Second, it will design and implement high\u2011level programming frameworks and data structures tailored to dynamic graph workloads, including graphics processing unit (GPU) and distributed implementations, to facilitate practical adoption. Third, it will integrate the new algorithms and frameworks into an open\u2011source analysis platform and conduct comprehensive evaluations on high\u2011performance computing clusters and cloud resources. These efforts will yield the first provably\u2011optimal dynamic subgraph counting algorithms for higher\u2011order patterns, query\u2011based enumeration techniques, and user\u2011friendly software enabling researchers to perform real\u2011time analysis on evolving networks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
