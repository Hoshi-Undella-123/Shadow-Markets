 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research investigates the impact of food commodity supply chains on local communities. Through a focus on the commodity supply chains of industrial meat production, investigators specifically test for the various factors that influence rural households, communities, and economic livelihoods. They also measure the variable impacts of local and imported meat production and consumption on agricultural communities and the adaptations that the communities undergo as they participate in the broader commodity supply chains of food production. Research activities include interview and behavioral data collection across food commodity supply chains. The broader impacts plan includes training of a graduate student in anthropological science and widespread dissemination plans to various stakeholders in this bioeconomy. \r\n\r\nThe research findings will make contributions to the anthropology of food and food production and to local management of bioeconomy. It will significantly expand our understanding of commodity supply chains related to food. The project furthers research that fuels economic prosperity, particularly in the agricultural sectors and impacts investments in understanding human adoption of biotechnology innovations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
