 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will support student participation and travel to the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) for the 2026 meeting, to be held January 3\u20137, 2026.  PSB is one of the oldest continuous conferences in computational biology and bioinformatics. Its unique format\u2014small size, no parallel sessions, and a dynamic, community-driven structure\u2014 fosters interdisciplinary discussion and collaboration. Participants (200-300 each year) come from around the world, and the meeting setting promotes open dialogue and sustained collaborations. This award will provide support only for students at US-based institutions, aiming to strengthen the competitiveness of the US in the science and technology areas. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide travel support to U.S.-based students presenting research at PSB. Like a Gordon Research Conference, it encourages deep engagement across all levels of the field. The meeting is built from the ground up each year through a call for session and workshop proposals. Approximately 15 proposals are submitted annually, of which 5\u20136 sessions and 4\u20136 workshops are selected. This model supports innovation and the timely introduction of new research topics. All accepted presenters receive information about the travel award application process, and support is prioritized for students giving oral presentations, though poster presenters are also eligible. The small size of PSB creates an ideal environment for students to engage with senior researchers, forge professional connections, and create opportunities for mentorship and future collaborations. Many student participants also take part in session or workshop planning, gaining hands-on leadership experience early in their careers. Because sessions are proposed and developed by participants, PSB often becomes the first venue to highlight emerging research areas. This commitment to community-driven innovation promotes scientific advancement and fosters the next generation of leaders in computational biology\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
