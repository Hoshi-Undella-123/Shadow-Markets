 "awd_abstract_narration": "Entangled materials, composed of particles with hooks, barbs, or geometric features that mechanically interlock, hold great promise as lightweight, strong, and recyclable alternatives to traditional structural materials. Unlike metallic foams or fiber composites, entangled materials can adapt their internal structure, self-heal from damage, and be reconfigured or recycled indefinitely. Despite their potential for use in aerospace, infrastructure, defense, and energy systems, a fundamental understanding of how particle geometry governs entanglement, strength, and failure is missing. Currently, there are no predictive models or design guidelines to engineer entangled materials with targeted mechanical properties. The objective of this project is to develop a unified mechanics-based framework to understand and control entanglement, which seeks to enable rational design of next-generation structural materials.\r\n\r\nThe project will integrate computational modeling, analytical theory, and experimental validation to capture how entanglement forms, evolve, and breaks under load. New tools, including geometric entanglement criteria, Markov chain-based models, and network descriptors for force pathways, will be developed and coupled with discrete element simulations. These models will be validated through physical prototypes fabricated using 3D printing and precision laser cutting, and tested using in-situ mechanical experiments with refractive index matched scanning (RIMS). The outcomes intend to include design principles for creating entangled materials with high tensile strength, fracture toughness, and damage tolerance, as well as the ability to self-heal or disassemble under vibration. Educational components involve curriculum development, graduate and undergraduate research, local high school engagement, and mentoring activities aimed at broadening participation in materials science and mechanics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
