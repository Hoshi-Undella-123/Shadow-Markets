 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2025 conference on Stem Cells, Cell Therapies, and Bioengineering in Lung Biology and Diseases at the University of Vermont in Burlington, 7-10 July 2025, will mark the 20th anniversary of this important biennial meeting. Over the past two decades, this conference has provided a platform for advancing research and collaboration in lung biology. This meeting stimulates discussion and debate by international leaders, new and emerging investigators, and trainees in the field. Meeting participants will also develop and publish guidelines for investigators and funding agencies on basic and translational research in stem cells, lung biology, and bioengineering. Junior investigators and trainees will involved in conference organization, oral presentations, chairing activities, discussions, and poster sessions. In 2025 the High School Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Experience will be expanded. This program will cultivate the next generation of scientists by providing an opportunity for high school students to engage with scientists from around the world and learn about state-of-the-art scientific techniques.\r\n\r\nThe repair and regeneration of diseased lungs using stem cells or bioengineered tissues represent transformative therapeutic strategies for a range of lung diseases and critical illnesses. Advances in preclinical models have demonstrated the potential for stem cell-based approaches to modulate immune responses and facilitate tissue repair following lung injury. Additionally, bioengineering research using artificial and acellular matrices as scaffolds for three-dimensional lung and airway regeneration has made strides, including promising transplantation attempts in large animal models. These efforts are complemented by a growing understanding of how endogenous lung stem and progenitor cells differentiate and contribute to repair and remodeling during lung development and after injury. In addition to attracting leading figures in lung biology and disease, the conference regularly features renowned stem cell experts from other disciplines, facilitating cross-pollination of ideas and innovation. For the 2025 conference, scientific symposia have been chosen to reflect the most cutting-edge advances in the field and will include sessions focusing on the integration of omics with function, matrix-cell dynamics, and immune cell contributions to repair and regeneration. Sessions will explore how inflammatory and mechanical cues influence stem cell regulation and highlight technological breakthroughs in bioengineering, such as precision-cut lung slices, hydrogels, and biomechanical modulation of lung function. These cutting edge basic and translational science studies are rapidly enhancing fundamental understanding of lung repair and regeneration, and the planned conference will continue to help shape further progress.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
