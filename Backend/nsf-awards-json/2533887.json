 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of a next-generation microscopy tool designed to detect an extremely small amount of electric charge and measure electric potential at nanometer scale. As electronic devices and quantum systems become smaller and more complex, currently available microscopy tools struggle to reveal the detailed electrical properties necessary for new technological breakthroughs. This problem is especially relevant in fields such as quantum computing, nanoelectronics, and advanced semiconductor device manufacturing, where understanding and controlling electric fields at the smallest scales directly affects device performance and reliability. This technology provides ultra-sensitive, high-resolution imaging and may be easier to use and more affordable than other existing solutions. Its adoption may accelerate the creation of new materials and quantum devices, benefitting a wide range of industries and supporting scientific advancements that impact everyday life.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of scanning single-electron box (SSEB) microscopy. This technology integrates a single-electron box on an atomic force microscopy (AFM) probe, providing highly sensitive measurements of charge and electric potential with sub-nanometer spatial resolution. Unlike conventional methods such as scanning single-electron transistor, SSEB microscopy detects single-electron tunneling events as shifts in the probe's resonant frequency and damping, allowing practical implementation and compatibility with cryogenic atomic force microscopy (AFM) systems. This technology may be used to investigate fluctuating charges that disrupt quantum bits. In addition, it also enables mapping dopant distributions and defects in advanced semiconductor devices, analyzing semiconductor-insulator interfaces, and characterizing charge transport in novel transistor architectures such as fin field-effect transistors (FinFETs) and nanowire-based devices. The technology may be used to investigate ferroelectric materials for non-volatile memories, detect localized charge traps impacting device reliability, and evaluate nanoscale components in integrated circuits. By supporting ultra-sensitive characterization across quantum, semiconductor, and nanoelectronic fields, SSEB microscopy may allow researchers and developers to advance high-performance computing, sensing, and communications, paving the way toward more reliable and powerful next-generation technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
