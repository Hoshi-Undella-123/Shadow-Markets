 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) requests funds for shipboard scientific support equipment that are needed to carry out NSF-supported scientific research on board the R/V Neil Armstrong and R/V Atlantis, two vessels operating as part of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF). The specific equipment requested include an emergency escape hatch for one of WHOI\u2019s portable radioisotope laboratory vans; a 12-channel sonar synchronization unit for R/V Armstrong to allow for more of the ship\u2019s acoustic systems to be run simultaneously; and a new meteorological and navigation (Met/Nav) foremast for R/V Atlantis, which would replace the original 30-year old mast that is suffering severe corrosion and has become a safety and operational concern. Due to budget constraints and other competing priorities, only the emergency escape hatch and the new Met/Nav mast are being funded. This equipment will help ensure the vessels maintain their high-level capabilities to support NSF-funded research and will improve the safety of the systems they are replacing or augmenting.\r\n\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 23-525). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance, and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or other organization access to well-maintained, high-quality, calibrated instruments for their research. It ensures the collection of high-quality oceanographic data in support of science, reduces the cost of that research, and expands the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
