 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to support research focused on developing and testing fast-flood-modeling technologies. It looks to answer two key questions. First, what flood simulation technologies maximally speed up simulations of flood risks under multiple flood drivers and response options, while maintaining accuracy? And second, with these technological innovations, can the design of flood infrastructure systems become substantially more efficient, lowering costs and improving effectiveness? Extreme weather events pose increasing challenges for protecting property and critical infrastructure from harm, and flood disaster damages amount to billions of dollars per year. Although many response options are possible, identifying effective and efficient improvements to infrastructure systems involves enormous constraints and complexity. As a fundamental bottleneck for this decision making, flood simulation technologies have been too computationally demanding\u2014and therefore too slow\u2014to adequately support the evaluation and coordination of infrastructure improvements. This research project seeks to advance fast-flood-simulation technologies that could transform the design of flood-safe infrastructure systems.\r\n\r\nThis research project combines expertise in civil engineering and adaptation science in a high-risk, interdisciplinary research approach that could significantly enhance the performance of flood infrastructure systems during both extreme and non-extreme operating conditions. The project looks to innovate and evaluate maximum flood modeling speeds and determining their impact on decision making. These benchmarks of maximum flood modeling speeds define future technology development goals and can catalyze the design of flood infrastructure in support of national health, economic prosperity, and national security. The project seeks to enable governments at all levels to improve and manage their flood infrastructure systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
