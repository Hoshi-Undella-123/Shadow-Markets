 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of a more efficient and environmentally friendly cooling system for cold chain logistics. Small parcel shipments of temperature-sensitive goods, such as food, pharmaceuticals, and biologics, currently rely on passive cooling methods, including dry ice, pre-conditioned gel packs, and expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam insulation. These materials are energy-intensive to produce, generate excessive waste, and offer limited temperature control, leading to spoilage and inefficiencies. This project seeks to replace these disposable packaging solutions with a reusable, refrigerant-free, magnetocaloric cooling shipper that provides precise and reliable temperature control without the environmental and safety risks of conventional methods. By enabling lightweight, portable cooling solutions, this technology has the potential to improve supply chain efficiency, reduce food and medical waste, and create a more sustainable approach to temperature-controlled transport. If successful, this innovation could generate high-value manufacturing and engineering jobs while enhancing U.S. leadership in advanced cooling technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the development of a high-power-density cooling system that utilizes the magnetocaloric effect, a phenomenon where certain materials heat up or cool down in response to a changing magnetic field. The research aims to overcome long-standing commercialization barriers by developing a compact, energy-efficient cooling system specifically designed for mobile applications. Key technical challenges include designing an advanced active magnetic cooling device that balances high thermal performance with low fluid resistance, integrating a layered magnetic material system to achieve a broad temperature span, and optimizing system controls to maximize efficiency in real-world shipping environments. This project will use experimental testing and computational modeling to refine magnet and regenerator designs, ensuring the system can reliably maintain refrigerated (5\u00b0C) and frozen (-20\u00b0C) conditions under varying ambient temperatures. By addressing these challenges, this research will lay the foundation for a commercially viable magnetocaloric cooling solution, vastly transforming the way temperature-sensitive goods are transported.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
