 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on a portable water-quality sensing technology that provides fast, on-site detection of toxic mercury in water. Mercury contamination is a serious public health issue that can affect people throughout the U.S. Most current testing methods are slow, costly, and require special equipment and trained personnel, which makes real-time water monitoring difficult, especially in emergencies. This new technology offers an affordable and easy-to-use alternative that permits individuals and families to check water quality themselves. By making water testing more accessible, this solution helps protect public health and strengthens the ability of communities to respond to water challenges, especially during extreme weather events.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a compact, fast sensor that can detect very small amounts of mercury in water. The design uses a new approach that leverages optoelectric materials to achieve high accuracy and sensitivity without the need for large or expensive lab equipment. The sensor delivers quick results and can be easily integrated to existing water systems. What makes this technology unique is its use of low-cost and precise control methods with greatly improved performance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
