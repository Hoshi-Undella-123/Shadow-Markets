 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) EPSCoR Graduate Fellowship Program (EGFP) supports EGFP designated institutions and programs in EPSCoR jurisdictions by providing funding for graduate fellowships for new or continuing EGFP-eligible applicants. EGFP awards provide support for a total of three years of stipend and associated cost-of-education (COE) allowance for each NSF EPSCoR Graduate Fellow.\r\n\r\nThis award at Kansas State University provides support to 9 EPSCoR Graduate Fellows whose research will align with the unique goals and programs supported by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS). The program is hosted in the Department of Mathematics and is designed to meet career goals of each participant. Through mentorship and faculty engagement, the program has the potential to produce highly qualified graduates who will excel in professional fields, including top-tier postdoctoral positions, national laboratories, leading industries, and educational institutions at all levels.\r\n\r\nIn this project, EPSCoR Graduate Fellows will participate in graduate studies in several fields of mathematics, including analysis, algebra, applied mathematics (including data science, materials science, and scientific computing), geometry/topology, mathematics education, and number theory. Fellows will be recruited nationally and mentored by a team of well qualified and dedicated faculty. Robust mechanisms are in place to support student success, ensuring personalized mentoring and encouraging professional development. Apart from intensive research experience, fellows will have the opportunity to pursue summer internships and engage in teaching and mentoring of undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
