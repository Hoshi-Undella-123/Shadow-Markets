 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how speech evolves over time and across different regions is crucial for understanding human communication. This project advances knowledge by developing the first digital resource that charts the phonological structures of an extensively used yet underexplored form of spoken language. By examining linguistic patterns from various communities, the project offers insights into how mobility, geography, and societal change influences language. This research not only broadens our grasp of linguistic variation but also provides practical applications, such as refining speech processing technologies and guiding language-based initiatives in education, healthcare, and the judicial system. Furthermore, the project fosters public interest in linguistic studies through community engagement efforts, educational materials, and digital platforms, while also supporting mentorship initiatives. \r\n\r\nThis study explores phonological structures by conducting linguistic interviews with 160 participants across different regions. Utilizing phonetic analysis techniques and spatial mapping tools, the project investigates sound-based phenomena, including phonemic transitions and vowel system alterations, to gain deeper insights into linguistic shifts and regional speech distinctions. The study contributes to the disciplines of phonology, language variation, and dialectology by supplying new empirical evidence and theoretical insights. The educational aspects of the project incorporate research findings into undergraduate curricula and public engagement activities, such as a cross-disciplinary academic program and interactive digital content. Publicly available materials include an auditory archive, geolocated linguistic maps, and instructional resources aimed at enhancing linguistic knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
