 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant funds the purchase of two new instruments, a new particle size analyzer and a new centrifuge, for use by the Geology department at Cal Poly Humboldt, other faculty and students at the university, and scientists in the rural Humboldt region (e.g. those working at local consulting firms and state and federal agencies). Measuring particle size is a common method in the Earth Sciences. This technique is used to determine sediment transport in river systems, travel distance of volcanic ash, and to reconstruct past environments. Centrifugation uses rapid, motorized spinning of samples to mechanically separate different minerals from each other and to rinse solvents from sediments. These instruments will give both undergraduate and graduate students first-hand experience conducting lab work- from learning lab protocols and running samples independently to analyzing data. Hands-on data collection and analysis are skills that will better prepare them for future careers in the geosciences. \r\n\r\nThis grant proposal is for the acquisition of a laser diffraction particle size analyzer and a benchtop centrifuge. Currently there is not an available particle size analyzer within 300 miles of the Cal Poly Humboldt campus, which means we need to send samples to outside labs for analysis. This is costly, time consuming and deprives both undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to gain experience using lab instrumentation.  Determining particle size is an important measurement in many aspects of the Earth Sciences. For example, it can characterize the energy level of the depositional environment in a lake, be used to interpret aspects of a volcanic eruption such as eruption volume and transport mechanics of pyroclastic currents, be used in fault characterization in paleo-seismic trenching surveys, and help determine provenance of ancient fluvial sands. Additionally, processing samples using a benchtop centrifuge is an integral part of mineral separation in thermochronology using minerals such as zircon and apatite. California State Polytechnic University Humboldt (Cal Poly Humboldt), is the California State University (CSU) system\u2019s third polytechnic and only one in Northern California. The new revised mission includes providing hands-on learning opportunities to better prepare students to solve the challenges of our time. Cal Poly Humboldt is dedicated to addressing workforce shortages in the sciences. Although Cal Poly Humboldt is set in one of the most unique natural geological settings which offers a natural laboratory for students and faculty, it is the most geographically isolated campus in the CSU system. This grant will directly impact faculty and students by acquiring in-house instrumentation to centrifuge samples and measure particle size from various sources, providing direct, hands-on opportunities for research and education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
