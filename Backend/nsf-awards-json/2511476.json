 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support about 12 U.S.-based student researchers participating in the Doctoral Consortium to be held in conjunction with the 2025 International Conference on Pervasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments (PETRA 2025). The PETRA mission is to promote interdisciplinary research on ways to use pervasive ambient intelligent environments to improve quality of life and enhance human performance with greater capabilities. The conference covers an array of topics in computational science, psychology, nursing, rehabilitation, artificial intelligence, computer vision, robotics, computer engineering, user interfaces, neuroscience, and many other areas.  Through attending the doctoral consortium, promising young scholars will receive thoughtful mentoring from, and connect to, more senior members of the community, with benefits to both student attendees and the community as a whole.   \r\n\r\nThe Doctoral Consortium program will afford student authors of papers accepted for presentation at the conference a unique opportunity to gain additional exposure for their innovative ideas and connect to an academic network both among themselves and with senior colleagues. The program consists of special sessions at the beginning, during, and at the end of the conference that involve close interactions with mentors around developing and publishing their work, as well as a chance to present posters to the wider conference. Students will be selected based on financial need, quality and relevance of the students' work to PETRA research topics, and creating a diverse consortium in terms of personal, disciplinary, and institutional backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
