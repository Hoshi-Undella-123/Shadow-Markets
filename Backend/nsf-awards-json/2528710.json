 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of nanotechnology, dedicated to understanding and controlling matter at the nanoscale, has generated immense global interest. Materials at the nanoscale exhibit physical, chemical, and biological properties that differ significantly from their bulk counterparts. Harnessing these unique characteristics through nanostructuring has the potential to substantially enhance and revolutionize numerous technological and industrial sectors, including information technology, medicine and health-care, transportation, energy, food safety, and environmental science. To continue to spur development in the field of Nanotechnology for societal benefit, it is imperative for global researchers to engage, discuss latest advancements, and establish impactful collaborations. This award will provide partial travel support for students and early-career researchers to attend the 6th African Nano Conference/Workshop on Applications of Nanotechnology to Energy, Environment, Agriculture, and Health.  The conference, which will take place July 14-19, 2025 at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, will gather international research leaders, students, and industry representatives to explore innovative applications of nanotechnology across these critical fields.\r\n\r\nThe nanotechnology conference offers extensive opportunities for U.S. researchers to engage with their global peers, fostering meaningful exchanges and expanding perspectives and knowledge in pivotal areas such as energy, water, agriculture, environment, and health technologies. In addition, the conference will also cover the computational aspects of nanotechnology through a special session that is focused on latest computational tools for materials discovery including machine learning to advance the field of nanotechnology. It also serves as an essential platform for establishing and nurturing collaborative relationships between U.S. and African researchers, laying the groundwork for significant international research initiatives. Furthermore, the conference supports the growth of a globally connected STEM workforce and will serve to strategically attract students to STEM disciplines, thus playing a critical role in meeting the rising global demand for skilled STEM professionals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
