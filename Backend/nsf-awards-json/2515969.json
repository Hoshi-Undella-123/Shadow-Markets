 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Conference on Scalable Scientific Data Management 2025 is a key event for the community performing research and development in managing scientific data efficiently. The conference is for experts, researchers, practitioners, and developers who want to share and discuss the latest research, tools, and techniques in this field. This NSF student travel award will support participation of students from US universities to attend the conference and to participate in a student poster competition. The SSDBM 2025 poster competition gives students a chance to present their latest research in data management, get feedback from experts, and gain recognition for their work. Participation in an international event such as SSDBM will enable the students to get a global picture of the developments happening in the rapidly evolving scientific data management domain. Their participation will help them to enter the next-generation high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) workforce with increased expertise on data management, software design and reuse, and sustainability. \r\n \r\nManaging massive amounts of scientific data has been crucial for accelerating scientific discoveries with the ever-increasing rate of data generation by scientific simulations, experiments, and observations. This flood of data is both a challenge and an opportunity for groundbreaking discoveries. Efficient data management ensures faster analysis, smoother collaboration among researchers, and better integrity of the data that enhances reproducible science. Modern science creates not only statistical data, but also spatial, temporal, and streaming data.  Students attending this conference receive exposure to cutting-edge research in scalable scientific data management, enhanced presentation skills, valuable networking opportunities, career development, open-source software development exposure, software optimization training, and interactions with leading professionals in data management research. Attending SSDBM 2025 better prepares students for their careers in national laboratories, HPC centers, cloud companies, and academia, bridging the gap between academic research and real-world applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
