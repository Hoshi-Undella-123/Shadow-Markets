 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides international experiences for undergraduate electrical and computer engineering students from the University of Alabama to research advanced electronics in the Czech Republic (Czechia). The goal is to help prepare a new generation of engineers who are ready to meet the growing demands of the U.S. semiconductor and microelectronics industry. Through hands-on experience in designing and building circuits, students will gain valuable technical skills while also learning to work as a member of an international team. By living and working in Czechia for 12-weeks, students will gain a deeper understanding of different cultures and global collaboration in engineering.\r\n\r\nAll research conducted through this IRES project has a shared focus on fractional-order circuits and systems - a cutting-edge area in electronics. Students investigate challenges such as modeling and fabricating fractional-order components, designing new types of circuits for signal processing using fractional-order components, and using fractional-order electrical models to analyze crops and liquids for food safety. Thes research experiences help increase student interest to pursue careers in circuits and systems, increase science and interpersonal communication skills, and increase intercultural maturity through living abroad. Students are trained through intensive research projects at the Brno University of Technology (BUT) in Czechia, a global leader in fractional-order circuits and systems research. These projects require both theoretical understanding and practical skills in electronics design, simulation, fabrication, and validation. With support from expert mentors at BUT, students contribute to advancing fractional-order systems while gaining skills directly aligned with future U.S. workforce needs in microelectronics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
