 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference Frontiers in Stochastic Analysis will be held at Purdue University from August 11 to August 13, 2025. Following the success of the inaugural FISA conference, hosted at the University of Illinois Chicago in 2023, this event brings together leading experts in stochastic analysis to present lectures on a wide range of cutting-edge research topics. A key aim is to provide a platform for early-career researchers \u2014 including senior graduate students and postdoctoral scholars \u2014 to present their work and engage with the broader research community.\r\n\r\nProbability theory provides a fundamental framework for the study of random phenomena, many of which can be modeled using continuous stochastic processes or random fields. Stochastic analysis, a dynamic and growing area within probability theory, offers essential tools for investigating these processes. The research topics featured at this conference reflect several key areas of stochastic analysis that have seen intense development in recent years. The broad scope of topics is designed to expand the perspectives and interests of graduate students and early-career researchers. Additionally, the conference provides a platform for interaction between generations of researchers as well as across distinct areas of stochastic analysis. The website of the conference is: https://fisa2025.weebly.com\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
