 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year renewal Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site will support the training of nine students for 10 weeks during the summers. REU students will be engage in biomedical engineering, a crucial area of importance in the U.S. Students will learn how to conduct research by working in teams which combine the fields of engineering and medicine. The project addresses current needs in the workforce by providing exposure to biomedical engineering devices as well as the academic and industrial skills necessary to produce them. Participants will receive hands-on experience with biomedical engineering devices such as wearable sensors, nanomedicine creation, and medical imaging equipment. The overall goals of the project are to increase the number of students entering the engineering workforce, advancing engineering training, and expand opportunities in engineering and research education.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide an enriching, intensive research experience in biomedical engineering (BME) devices for undergraduate students. Structured research activities will be complemented by professional development training tailored to prepare participants for successful careers in STEM research. Students will have opportunities to engage in cutting-edge research projects covering areas such as medical instrument design, implanted devices, nanomedicine, and tissue engineering. Hands-on research in laboratories, mentorship from faculty with broad expertise in both academics and industry, weekly educational seminars, and collaborative project work will comprise the program. This approach ensures that students not only gain practical skills but also develop a comprehensive understanding of the complexities and challenges in biomedical engineering. REU participants will actively contribute to publishing their research findings through presentations and publications in engineering research and education journals.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by EEC Workforce Development and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
