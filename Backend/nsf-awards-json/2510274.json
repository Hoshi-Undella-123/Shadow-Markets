 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Middle Tennessee State University will establish a transformative graduate training program in quantum information science (QIS) and artificial intelligence (AI). The project addresses a critical national need to develop a diverse, technically skilled workforce capable of advancing these fast-evolving fields. Trainees will explore emerging applications ranging from quantum computing to ethical AI for biomedical diagnostics and national cybersecurity. The program is designed to build interdisciplinary expertise, and prepare students for careers in academia, industry, and government. It will integrate coursework, hands-on research, and professional development, while fostering collaboration across mathematics, physics, computer science, chemistry, and biomedical science. The project anticipates training of 40 graduate students, including 16 funded trainees\u2014from master\u2019s and doctoral programs, and 24 additional non-stipend trainees from fields such as computational science, quantum materials, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.  This effort builds on MTSU\u2019s Quantum Science Initiative, the Data Science Institute, and the emerging Quantum Information and Materials Center (QIMC) to develop an interdisciplinary platform for both research and training at the intersection of QIS and AI.\r\n\r\nThis traineeship will advance the frontier of interdisciplinary research through three integrated research themes. First, the project will develop quantum machine learning models and quantum-enhanced algorithms for high-dimensional data integration and cybersecurity. Second, it will create new computational methods for modeling quantum materials with strong electronic correlation and disorder, utilizing novel Density Functional Theory (DFT) approaches and many-body embedding techniques. Third, it will apply quantum computing and ethical AI frameworks to biomedical challenges, including cancer immunotherapy optimization and early detection of mental health biomarkers such as autism and ADHD. The program incorporates a relationship-rich, work-integrated training model that includes individualized development plans, multi-tier mentoring, and continuous evaluation. Training will include a new Quantum Information Science Track within MTSU\u2019s Computational and Data Science PhD, multidisciplinary research teams, multi-tiered mentoring, and professional development in ethical and responsible research in QISE and AI.  Through its innovative blend of science, education, and ethics, this project will contribute to building a robust QIS and AI workforce and expand access to high-impact research opportunities in the southeastern U.S.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, and potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
