 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a system that can produce very pure hydrogen for portable energy devices, while also turning metal ores into useful metals at the same time. The system uses electrolysis (a process where electricity splits water into hydrogen and oxygen) to make very clean hydrogen gas. This hydrogen can be used in portable energy solutions\u2014like fuel cells in cars, mobile chargers, or backup power systems. At the same time, the system is also designed to process metal ores (natural rocks that contain metal). Using electricity and chemical reactions, it extracts the useful metals (like iron, copper, or nickel) from these ores, which can reduce waste and add value by turning raw materials into usable metals. The project addresses a critical national need by offering a scalable alternative to traditional energy and material extraction processes. The electrolysis targets dual challenges of ensuring secure energy storage and recovering essential metals used in high priority industrial and defense applications. This innovation promises societal benefits by enhancing energy security and contributing to the national interest through improved material recovery methods, which support economic growth, and the well-being for all Americans. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of an integrated electrolysis process that combines advanced non-precious group metal (PGM) / metal oxide (MO) technology and optimized reaction conditions to yield ultrapure hydrogen while achieving the reduction of ores to extract critical metals. The technology leverages controlled electrochemical reactions and state-of-the-art material science to enhance purity and yield beyond conventional methods. Rigorous experimental validation and systematic parameter optimization ensure that the process delivers a consistent quality product and reliable performance under practical operating conditions. The technical innovation underlying this solution not only improves energy conversion efficiency but also contributes to national security by ensuring a stable supply of metals vital for industrial and defense applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
