 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chronic stress during pregnancy is a serious and often underestimated threat to maternal and fetal\r\nhealth, linked to complications such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Unfortunately,\r\ncurrent methods for monitoring stress in pregnant women are inadequate: questionnaires provide only\r\nsubjective, infrequent data, lab tests are invasive and sporadic, and existing wearable devices capture only\r\ngeneral physiological signals that are easily confounded by other factors. This project aims to fill that gap\r\nby creating a novel wearable tool for comprehensive stress monitoring. The device will continuously track\r\nboth physiological stress indicators (e.g., heart rate variability) and molecular stress biomarkers (e.g.,\r\nhormones and inflammatory markers) in real time. By enabling early and accurate detection of harmful\r\nstress levels, this project\u2019s goal will allow timely interventions to protect maternal and fetal health. In doing\r\nso, it aligns with NSF\u2019s mission by promoting scientific progress, advancing national health and welfare,\r\nand fostering interdisciplinary training.\r\n\r\nThe project main objective is to develop an innovative wearable research platform that integrates\r\nnovel molecular sensors with physiological sensors to enable comprehensive stress assessment during\r\npregnancy. The team will create new electrically regenerable molecular sensors that can repeatedly detect\r\nmultiple key stress biomarkers (e.g., cortisol and inflammatory cytokines) in interstitial fluid. These sensors\r\nwill be embedded into a flexible wristband alongside modules for monitoring physiological signals like heart\r\nrate variability and skin conductance. The integrated device will simultaneously and noninvasively measure\r\nmolecular and physical indicators of stress in real time. Finally, the platform will be tested on human subjects\r\nunder controlled stress conditions to validate its accuracy and reliability. This interdisciplinary work will\r\ndemonstrate a transformative wearable sensing paradigm, laying the groundwork for future continuous\r\nstress monitoring.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
