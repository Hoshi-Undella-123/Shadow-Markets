 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geomagnetic storms significantly impact satellite-based communication systems, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). Research into GPS position errors is a crucial aeronomy and space weather research topics for improving the accuracy and reliability of societal applications that rely on GPS technology, including agriculture and autonomous vehicles. Investigations into mid-latitude GPS performance are particularly important due to the dense populations in these regions. The proposed research on quantifying position errors and identifying mitigation methods will increase reliance on GPS, contributing to economic prosperity and national security. The project will also provide research opportunities for students and postdoctoral scholars, contributing to the development of the American workforce. The knowledge gained through this project, including signal processing techniques and scientific applications, will be incorporated into undergraduate courses to enhance undergraduate education. The proposal will support continued service to society by answering public questions and disseminating knowledge through lectures, contributing to improved public scientific literacy and engagement.\r\n\r\nThe project's goal is to understand GPS positioning errors at mid-latitudes in North America. The specific research objectives are: (1) How do GPS position errors evolve during severe storms, and how are these errors related to TEC structures? (2) How do GPS positioning errors depend on storm progression, locations, and seasons? (3) What physical and technical processes control these positioning errors? GPS receiver data from the NSF-supported GAGE facility will be used to compute GPS signal fluctuations and position errors. Investigations of GPS data during severe storms will address the evolution of plasma structures and position errors. GPS position errors at various storm levels will be analyzed to examine how these errors depend on storm strength. By using various input conditions, the project will determine how position errors change by modifying the input data and calculation algorithms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
