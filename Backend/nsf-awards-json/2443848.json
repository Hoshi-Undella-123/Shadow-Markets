 "awd_abstract_narration": "The digestion and absorption of food in the small intestine involve a complex array of processes. These processes encompass the transport of food particles along the intestinal tract, their mixing with digestive enzymes, and the movement of nutrients to the surface of the intestinal wall. These processes are facilitated by the rhythmic movements of the intestinal wall and microstructures on its inner surface. This suggests that the human body may regulate digestion and absorption in the small intestine by controlling these movements. This project will uncover the mechanisms by which the small intestine mixes and transports food particles, enzymes, and nutrients across different scales, ultimately regulating digestion and absorption. The study will employ advanced numerical simulations, theoretical analysis, and data analysis techniques to explore the intricate processes involved. \r\n\r\nThis project comprises high-fidelity numerical simulations of multiscale mechanisms, advanced theoretical analysis grounded in physics, and data analysis techniques leveraging machine learning. The primary objective is to establish a mechanistic framework for understanding how human physiological systems manage digestion and absorption by regulating these mixing and transport processes in the small intestine. This will be achieved through two specific goals; 1) Uncover the mechanisms of mixing, transport, and breakdown of chyme particles, along with dissolved enzymes and nutrients in intestinal fluids and 2) Identify the impact of mixing and transport processes in the small intestine under various conditions on food digestion, nutrient absorption, and energy consumption. The goal is to clarify the regulatory mechanisms of the human physiological system through comparison with in vivo intestinal motility patterns. This award will also advance multidisciplinary research and education in multiphase flows and will enhance the education of students in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by Particulate and Multiphase Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
