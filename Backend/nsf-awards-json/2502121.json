 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heating and cooling buildings accounts for over 40% of U.S. energy use. The high energy demand in urban Massachusetts and 2050 net-zero target underscore the urgent need for scalable, sustainable energy alternatives. One promising yet understudied solution is urban networked geothermal systems. These systems use ground-source heat pumps and underground loops to share thermal energy between buildings. This approach can improve efficiency and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, thereby cutting energy costs and offering reliable energy to communities. However, the absence of standardized tools to evaluate their long-term environmental, economic, and social impacts limit its implementation. This research project will develop a novel method to assess the sustainability of these systems in urban settings. The findings will inform local and regional energy planning, promote energy access, and serve as a blueprint for cities nationwide to transition to renewable energy.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop a regionally adaptable framework for evaluating the environmental, economic, and social sustainability of urban networked geothermal systems. The project will implement a dynamic model with spatial and temporal resolution to incorporate real-time performance data from pilot projects in Massachusetts, regional climate and grid characteristics, and community-level social data.  The model will assess impacts across the full system life cycle, from installation to decommissioning, including greenhouse gas emissions, life cycle costs, and social factors such as job creation, energy distribution, and public acceptance.  The method will be tested and refined across thirteen planned geothermal sites in Massachusetts, enabling comparisons with conventional heating and cooling systems and application across residential, commercial, and mixed-use building types. This project contributes to advancing sustainability modeling of complex energy infrastructure and offers data-driven insights for system optimization. The results of this project will guide utilities, municipalities, and community organizations in designing and scaling energy systems to expand access to sustainable heating and cooling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
