 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to 25 U.S.-based graduate students to attend the 2025 Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), to be held in October 2025. CCS is the flagship conference of the Special Interest Group on Security, Audit and Control of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The conference brings together information security researchers, practitioners, developers, and users from all over the world to explore cutting-edge cybersecurity ideas and results. CCS 2025 will include multiple technical tracks across a wide spectrum of cybersecurity topics, with hundreds of papers, pre-conference and post-conference workshops, tutorial and poster sessions, and panel discussions. Participation in the conference is a valuable opportunity for students and is an important part of graduate education in cybersecurity. The conference has special events aimed at connecting student attendees with mentors, further increasing the benefits students receive.\r\n\r\nStudents will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field both in the main conference and the associated workshops. This can lead to community-based research initiatives, knowledge sharing, and positive social impacts beyond academia. The conference will involve researchers, scholars, and professionals from diverse backgrounds, allowing students to build valuable connections and collaborations. To broaden perspectives and participation in the discipline, the organizing committee will conduct a wide outreach program to solicit applications, including from students in underrepresented groups who might not otherwise be able to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field as demonstrated by the applicant's description of their research background and plans, as well as their ability to both benefit from and contribute to the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
