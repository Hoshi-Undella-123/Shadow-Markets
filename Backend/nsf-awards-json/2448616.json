 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 22nd annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference to be held at Indiana University Bloomington from April 11-13, 2025. The conference is designed for graduate students and the majority of talks will be given by student participants. Such a gathering provides a chance for young researchers from many institutions and geographic regions to network and speak with experts in their fields. This conference exposes graduate students at all stages of study to the cutting edge of research in topology and geometry.\r\n\r\nThis conference is designed for young researchers to benefit from in different ways: enabling them to present their own work, engage with research in the frontiers of mathematics, sow the seeds of future collaborations, and interact with experts in their various fields. Special attention will be given to a wide variety of topics so that the upcoming generation of mathematicians is aware of the current trends in topology and geometry.  To this end, there will be plenary talks by Sarah Koch (University of Michigan), Mark Powell (University of Glasgow), and Inna Zakharevich (Cornell University). There will also be early-career talks by Agustina Czenky (University of Southern California), Beibei Liu (Ohio State University), Annibal M. Medina-Maradones (Western University), Maggie Miller (UT Austin), Carmen Rovi (Loyola University Chicago), and Roberta Shapiro (University of Michigan). The conference URL is https://topologyandgeometry.iu.edu/gstgc25/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
