 "awd_abstract_narration": "According to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Strategic Plan (2023), the United States faces a lack of both qualified and diverse cyber professionals. Compounding these concerns, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (2024), projects a 32% increase in cyber-related careers from 2022-2032, resulting in nearly 17,000 job openings annually. To address this need, this project will establish a one-year Dual Enrollment (DE) pathway for high school students to earn a Technical Certificate of Credit (TCC) in Cybersecurity Fundamentals.  Over three years, 135 students will be recruited into the program, gaining hands-on experiential learning through collaboration with local school systems and industry partners.  The project aims to improve the transition from K-12 to higher education and careers, improving student readiness in this high-demand field.  \r\n\r\nGPTC will structure the TCC as a two-semester program, integrating real-world simulations, professional interactions, and cybersecurity career exposure.  Students will earn 18 college credits, developing foundational skills in network security, risk management, and digital forensics.  The program culminates in a Student Showcase, where students present their skills to peers, faculty, and industry professionals. These activities will further strengthen the K-12 pipeline by establishing a pathway into for future enrollment into the college's cybersecurity program and other emerging technology fields, as well as an entry point into the workforce in a critical and high-demand field.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
