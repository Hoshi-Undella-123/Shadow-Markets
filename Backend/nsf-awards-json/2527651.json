 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Washington (Seattle, Washington) will host the 5th Biennial Pacific Northwest Section of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) meeting from October 3-5, 2025. This vertically integrated meeting will bring together individuals from undergraduates to distinguished researchers at universities, national labs, and industry mainly from the Pacific Northwest region. These conference participants, working at the forefront of applied and computational mathematics, have expertise in many of the key priority areas of the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS). The goal of the meeting is to facilitate the advancement of knowledge in cutting edge areas of applied mathematics and computational mathematics for the benefit of both the Pacific Northwest region and the US more broadly.\r\n\r\nThemes for the meeting will include sessions in numerical linear algebra, optimization, numerical methods for solving partial differential equations, image processing, inverse methods and data assimilation, high performance computing, numerical modeling and simulation in the geosciences. This year in particular, the meeting will showcase particular expertise in the Pacific Northwest on hazards modeling, including hazards from earthquakes, tsunamis, debris flows and volcanic activity. A website listing conference activities and details can be found at https://sites.google.com/site/siampnwsection/biennal-meeting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
