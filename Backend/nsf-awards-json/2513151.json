The symposium aims to capture recent and exciting developments at the frontiers of advanced quantum materials and its grand challenges in terms of large-scale production, high density, low-costs, and low energy consumption for multifunctional device-platforms.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\n\r\nQuantum magnetism has recently seen numerous advances including both the discovery of new material platforms as well as magnetic phases controllable through external stimuli, holding promise for enabling potential quantum technologies (QTs). The symposium aims to bring together an interdisciplinary group of experts in several aspects of quantum materials, device implementations, novel computing approaches. These will include high caliber experimentalists, device engineers, material scientists, theoreticians, and material informatics specialists, who will crosscut traditional disciplines involving physics, chemistry, and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
