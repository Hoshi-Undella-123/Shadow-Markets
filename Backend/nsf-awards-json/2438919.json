 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: X-ray tomography to characterize microstructure during stress tests constraining multiscale models of sea ice interaction\r\n\r\nSea ice in the Arctic Ocean has thinned and become more fragmented over the past several decades, a trend that poses significant challenges for navigation, infrastructure, and climate-related research. Increased variability in sea ice conditions affects shipping routes, offshore platforms, and coastal regions, creating a need for advanced tools to predict its behavior and inform resilient design strategies. This research seeks to uncover how the microstructural features of sea ice, such as grain size, porosity, and void distribution, influence its ability to withstand forces, such as the pressure exerted by an icebreaker or the stability needed to support offshore platforms, under varying environmental and mechanical loads. By developing a multiscale framework that connects microscale processes to large-scale dynamics, this project will generate insights critical for Arctic navigation, infrastructure design, and climate adaptation. The outcomes of this work will address key challenges at the intersection of geophysical science and engineering. In addition, the knowledge generated has broader relevance to other fields, including rock mechanics and geotechnical engineering. Outreach and education efforts will focus on the theme of \"North in the South,\" engaging students and the public through programs such as virtual reality experiences, and workshops on Arctic science. These initiatives aim to inspire the next generation of researchers and raise awareness of the critical role sea ice plays in the global climate system.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this research is to develop and validate multiscale numerical models that link the micromechanics of sea ice to its macroscopic behavior under various environmental conditions. This goal will be achieved using a combination of advanced experimental and computational techniques, including: (i) high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging to analyze the internal structure of sea ice and identify characteristic patterns and scales that influence its behavior; (ii) discrete element modeling (DEM) to simulate microscale interactions and failure mechanisms; and (iii) hybrid FEM-DEM simulations to integrate micro- and macroscale behaviors for macroscopic stress and strain predictions. Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations will be used in conjunction to investigate key phenomena, such as sea ice deformation, cracking, and floe-scale interactions. The validated models will provide new tools for understanding sea ice dynamics, supporting Arctic engineering, and addressing challenges posed by evolving ice conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
