 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates how to increase the impact of health risk messages in naturalistic settings by considering the social contexts in which messages are received. Many health campaign and intervention messages are based on well-tested theories. Though effective in controlled experiments, communication intervention messages often fall short in real-world contexts. This project tests how adding social support elements, including encouraging messages and information aids, can enhance health message effectiveness, such as increasing people\u2019s confidence in adopting risk mitigation behaviors. Study findings contribute to scientific progress and societal well-being by advancing knowledge in health communication and social support. The research provides insights into designing effective risk communication campaigns and interventions that account for social and contextual factors, offering a blueprint for improving health outcomes in the future. \r\n\r\nThe project involves a three-phase intervention. In the first two phases, interviews and focus groups are conducted to guide the development of intervention materials. In the third phase, an online intervention delivers a strategic health video to participants to influence their beliefs and intentions, followed by social support text messages for two weeks. The study provides practical guidance for designing health risk communication campaigns and interventions that are not only scientifically grounded but also responsive to real-life social contexts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
