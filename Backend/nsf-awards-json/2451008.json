 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project are in the development of a semiconductor device for use in power systems.  The device, called a switch, will have significantly lower power losses than existing systems.  It has the potential to transform a wide range of power conversion systems. By reducing energy losses, this technology will directly lead to significant savings. Commercially manufacturing the proposed semiconductor device in the US is important to maintaining US competitiveness and creating jobs in the chips manufacturing areas. The global high voltage power semiconductor market was valued at USD 4.1 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 5.9 billion by 2025. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to commercialize an innovative and patent-pending silicon Conductivity-Controlled Bipolar Transistor (CCBT) technology. This technology is designed to significantly reduce both conduction and switching losses in high-power electronics, addressing a critical need in the industry for more efficient and cost-effective solutions. The SBIR project will design and commercialize the 4.5kV-class Si-CCBT. Preliminary simulations demonstrate an 80% reduction in conduction loss, a 70% reduction in switching loss, and a 75% cost reduction compared to current Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) and Integrated Gate-Commutated Thyristor (IGCT) solutions. These advancements are expected to have a transformative impact on high-power electronics applications, including solar and battery storage systems, medium voltage motor drives, HVDC converters, solid-state circuit breakers, solid-state transformers, and pulse power systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
