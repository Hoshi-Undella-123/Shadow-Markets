 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sixty-Fourth Midwest Graph Theory Conference (Mighty LXIV) will be held at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, in September 2025. Mighty is a series of conferences devoted to graph theory, that is the mathematical description of networks, and its applications and has been held annually at different institutions in the Midwest regions for many years. The main goal of the conference is to bring researchers from the Midwest together to share their ideas and explore collaboration opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe conference will feature three plenary speakers who will focus on their recent contributions to structural graph theory. There will also be sessions of contributed talks, specifically allowing junior participants to present their work.  The website for the conference is at https://people.wright.edu/xiangqian.zhou\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
