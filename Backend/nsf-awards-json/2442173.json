 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many viruses in the environment threaten human health. Enteric viruses that cause diarrhea in humans are commonly found in municipal wastewater. Treated wastewater is increasing being used in farming, in industrial processes, in recreation, and in other proposes.  It is imperative to guarantee that disease-causing viruses are effectively removed from this water source. Treatment can be challenging because of the small size of viruses and their tendency to stick together with bacteria to infect humans more easily. This project will determine how these enteric viruses from wastewater cause human illnesses. This project will use cross-disciplinary tools in laboratory experiments and environmental surveys to address the question. The study outcomes will aid in the effective management of wastewater and will help protect public health. This project will also train students and help the public learn more about environmental viruses. \r\n\r\nAdvancing knowledge about the association between viruses and bacteria in aquatic environments is necessary to develop effective pathogen control strategies. This project will fill research gaps on the transmission, occurrence, and health impacts of bacteria-associated enteric viruses in aquatic environments and provide insights into the control of viral pathogens and protection of public health. The objectives of this research are to i) elucidate the impact of bacterial association on infectivity, environmental persistence, and disinfection resistance of enteric viruses; ii) investigate the occurrence, abundance, and removal of emerging bacteria-associated viruses in wastewater treatment and natural environments; and iii) explore the health impacts of bacteria-associated viruses through examining host responses. A suite of microbiology, omics, surveillance, and immunology tools will be integrated to achieve these objectives. The research will also be integrated into education to i) develop new education modules to foster students\u2019 understanding in environmental pathogens and water disinfection; ii) increase the number of students from diverse educational backgrounds pursuing careers related to water; and iii) raise the understanding of the public about environmental pathogens and their control. The outcomes of this project will provide a framework to evaluate the fate and transport of pathogens interacting with other substances in complex environments. In addition, this project will extend the boundaries of environmental engineering and environmental virology to include immunology, which will enhance the understanding of health risks posed by environmental pathogens through host-pathogen interactions beyond mere infection.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
