 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) requests funds for oceanographic instrumentation that are needed to carry out NSF-supported scientific research on board the R/V Neil Armstrong and R/V Atlantis, two vessels operating as part of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF). The specific suite of instrumentation requested include a 0.681 electro-optical winch wire termination and test kit for R/V Atlantis; a new liquid nitrogen generator for R/V Atlantis to replace a critical yet obsolete system; a GPS correction receiver; and two new fluorometer\u2019s for the R/V Armstrong to replace two units that are past the end of their service lives. Due to competing priorities and constrained budgets, only the 0.681 winch wire kit, liquid nitrogen generator, and new fluorometers are being recommended for funding. These instruments will help ensure the vessels maintain their high-level capabilities to support NSF-funded research.\r\n\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 23-525). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance, and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or other organization access to well-maintained, high-quality, calibrated instruments for their research. It ensures the collection of high-quality oceanographic data in support of science, reduces the cost of that research, and expands the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
