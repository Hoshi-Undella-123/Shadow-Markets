 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Pittsburgh, located in Pittsburgh, PA, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the Summers of 2025-2027. The program, entitled Training and Experimentation in Computational Biology (TECBio), will immerse students in a mentored research project in interdisciplinary areas of computational, quantitative, and systems biology. Students will gain independence and confidence as researchers working on real-world research projects, with some students having the opportunity to do research with a local biotechnology company. Student contributions will advance the ongoing research of faculty at the host institution and help drive innovation at the forefront of discovery. Students will also learn the essential skills needed to pursue additional training and careers in these emerging fields in both the academic and biotechnology sectors. Students will present their results at a regional symposium and will be encouraged to also present at other scientific conferences. Program assessment will be done using a Qualtrics version of the Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA) Survey. Students should apply to the REU site using the NSF ETAP (Education and Training Application: https://etap.nsf.gov). \r\n\r\nThe TECBio REU has the scientific theme of \u201cMultiscale Modeling, Simulation, and Systems-level Analyses for Biological Discovery\u201d and leverages the expertise of the host institution\u2019s Computational and Systems Biology Department as well as faculty from the Biological Sciences, Cell Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Structural Biology Departments, among others. TECBio trains students in current state-of-the-art methodologies that prepare them to address rapidly evolving challenges in computational and systems biology by immersing them in mentored, independent research projects in our interdisciplinary scientific focus areas. Example student projects include investigating the dynamics of biomolecular systems using molecular dynamics simulations, using generative modeling for pharmacophore elucidation, modeling cellular phenotype transitions, understanding molecular signals controlling cell fate decisions, and decoding the spatial language of developmental signaling. The research experience will be complemented by a curriculum of professional development and enrichment activities that include training in the responsible conduct of research, a journal club, a tailored research and career seminar series, graduate school, internship, and job prep, training in scientific communication, and opportunities to serve as a mentor and role model for other developing scientists. Formative and summative assessments of the program and student gains will be performed using a modified version of the URSSA developed by the program. Additionally, interviews with participants (students and mentors) will be conducted during and after the program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
