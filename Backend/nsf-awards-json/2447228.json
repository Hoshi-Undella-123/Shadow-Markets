 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. It has both scientific and societal benefits and integrates research and education. The REU Site for Translational Research in Behavior Science provides aspiring behavior scientists with high-quality research experience and mentorship. This project supports the development of a skilled workforce by fostering interest and participation in translational research in experimental psychology and preparing students for careers in science, education, and healthcare. REU participants conduct laboratory research in behavioral psychology and neuroscience. Research conducted for this project addresses questions relevant to NSF priority areas, including translational research and the science of public safety. Specifically, REU participants will conduct translational research in behavioral pharmacology, behavioral neuroscience, relapse prevention, prosocial behavior, behavioral approaches to injury rehabilitation, crime prevention and investigation, and improving the efficacy of behavioral interventions. Students present their work at public research symposia and are trained to communicate findings to scientific and general audiences. Their studies advance knowledge of behavioral processes and their application to socially significant challenges. Recruitment is open to NSF-eligible undergraduate students focusing on reaching students from institutions with limited research opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to foster interest and participation in experimental psychology and expand the pool of skilled researchers in behavior science. The objectives include: (1) Providing research opportunities to students from primarily undergraduate-serving institutions, (2) Involving students in impactful research that advances behavior science, (3) Improving students\u2019 technical research skills (4) Developing students\u2019 scientific and broader communication skills, (5) Retaining students in behavior science education and careers. Each year, a cohort of 8 REU participants works with faculty research mentors. Students attend a 3-day training, conduct a research project with their mentor, participate in weekly professional development seminars, and disseminate their work. Student projects contribute to refining behavioral theories through translational research, with implications for both understanding basic processes and informing applied outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
