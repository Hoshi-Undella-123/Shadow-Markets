 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes addressing critical unmet medical needs by developing an innovative platform to create new cancer therapies specifically designed to target and destroy cancer cells for a broad range of different cancers. It is estimated that approximately 90% of cancer deaths occur due to cancers becoming resistant to current treatments. This project aims to significantly enhance the effectiveness of cancer therapies by providing novel strategies to overcome this resistance. The commercial potential of this platform is substantial, driven by the urgent need for effective treatments targeting therapy-resistant cancers, such as lung, breast, and prostate cancer. Given the large patient populations affected by these cancers, the estimated annual revenue potential for a single therapy addressing just one of these cancer types in the United States exceeds $5 billion. Successful development of this project could facilitate the rapid creation and deployment of multiple new treatments, substantially improving patient outcomes and creating significant economic impact.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop and validate a novel platform for targeted cancer therapies, which function similarly to guided missiles. In these targeted therapies, the payload is the core element responsible for destroying cancer cells upon delivery. The targeting component functions as a guidance system that directs the payload specifically to cancer cells by recognizing unique or abundant proteins on their surface. Traditional chemotherapy often fails because cancer cells evolve resistance mechanisms, rendering conventional treatments ineffective and often causing significant side effects. This project specifically targets an alternative cell-death pathway that cancer cells cannot easily evade. Research objectives include designing and synthesizing new payload candidates, testing their effectiveness and selectivity against therapy-resistant cancer cells, and verifying their performance in laboratory models. Anticipated results include identifying at least two promising payload candidates, demonstrating their selective anti-cancer properties, and establishing proof-of-concept for this innovative therapeutic approach, thus paving the way for broader applications in cancer treatment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
