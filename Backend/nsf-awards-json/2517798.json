 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research investigates the impacts of digital innovations on eldercare in aging societies. Researchers specifically test the extent to which digital tools and an eldercare industry can transform the quality and capacities for elder care. Investigators specifically study the use of a wide range of digital platforms and smart technical devices such as wearable sensors, telecare and telemedicine, big data platforms for health monitoring and prediction, and smart home technology. Broader impacts of this research include training of a graduate student and dissemination of findings at industry conferences, through podcasts, and in public venues that focus on elder-care practices.\r\n\r\nResearch findings will contribute to understanding the intersections between technological innovations and society. The data will inform the future management of eldercare and aging and responds to research priorities in the science of artificial intelligence through the study and usage of computers and software capable of intelligent behavior and their impact on society. The research also contributes to the translation of findings into novel use-inspired technologies to improve elder care management.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
