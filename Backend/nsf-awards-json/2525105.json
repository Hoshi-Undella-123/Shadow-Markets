 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanotechnology research and commercial products will likely remain at the forefront of scientific discoveries and applications for the next decade. The Florida Association for Nanotechnology, founded in 2019, aims to create a network of researchers, faculty, industry affiliates, and students, who study nanoscience, technology and nanoscale interactions. The NanoFlorida International Conference will be hosted by Florida International University on March 14-16, 2025, in Miami, Florida.  The conference will provide a platform for scientific exchange, collaborative research advances, and an expanding network of professionals and students to forge partnerships and collaborations in the field. The conference's aim is to increase collaborations between domestic and international researchers, with a broader focus on nanoscale interaction understanding, processing, and awareness. Post-conference surveys and publications of presenters\u2019 research will be used to measure the success of this year\u2019s conference objectives. Conference objectives encompass promoting collaborative and interdisciplinary research, expanding multidisciplinary education and research projects, hosting presentations by experts in the field, and providing new insights into nanoscale interactions for nanoscientists, clinicians, and engineers. \r\n\r\nThe conference rotates geographical locations in Florida to promote and increase awareness of nanotechnology applications and nanoscale interactions. This year\u2019s conference will include symposia on advances in nanoscale interactions, nanotechnology in drug delivery and medicine, nanobiotechnology, artificial intelligence in nanotechnology, nanomaterials and devices for biosensing, and their applications in energy, medicine, agriculture, and space sciences. It will provide new opportunities for students to network with researchers from academic institutions and the broader nanotechnology industry. The conference will provide a supportive and inclusive environment for students to hone their science communication and presentation skills. Students will have the opportunity to meet researchers from other institutions and industry settings, forming professional relationships that provide long-term benefits to students\u2019 STEM education and careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
