 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate how molecules behave when they are confined in very small pores.  It is an important problem for a variety of applications including the design of catalysts, purification processes, and drug delivery systems.  Controlling the size and geometry of small pores in an experimental system is challenging, especially for the case where the pores are hydrophobic (water-repelling).  This project will synthesize polymeric nanospheres that contain gold nanoparticles to serve as templates for the pores. The gold nanoparticles will then be removed, leaving a porous nanosphere.  The geometry and distribution of the pores will be adjusted by modifying the gold nanoparticle templates.  The project will investigate how modifying these pores influences the physical and chemical properties of the nanospheres and their interactions with the environment.  The project will provide opportunities for students at all academic levels to develop research skills, and the team will collaborate in outreach activities with Stevens\u2019 High School Enrichment and ACES (Accessing Careers in Engineering and Science) Programs.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop porous polymeric nanoparticles and investigate their porosity-dependent interactions with the surroundings. Control over the cavities will be achieved by incorporating sacrificial nanoparticles into the internal liquid crystalline phase of nanospheres and subsequently etching them away, leaving pores that resemble the geometry and distribution of the sacrificial nanoparticles. This project can determine principles for transferring directional properties of the liquid-crystalline phase by optimizing the incorporation process of sacrificial nanoparticles. Investigating the etching kinetics and thermodynamics of the embedded nanoparticles will inform non-hydrophobic interactions in confined environments, with implications for catalysis (e.g., nanozymes) and energy storage via controlled molecular transport. Additionally, porosity-dependent adsorption behaviors of molecules with varied properties and sizes will be determined, which can lead to improved strategies for impurity separation, energy storage, catalysis, and cargo delivery. In the long term, these activities will benefit the development of smart nanomaterials with advanced properties that can sense, report, and respond to environmental changes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
