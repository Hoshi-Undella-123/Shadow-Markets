 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to advance our understanding of the dynamic interaction between mantle flow, crustal deformation, and topography beneath Antarctica by developing a high-resolution geodynamic model using the mantle convection code ASPECT. The model simulates mantle flow and crustal dynamics from the time of the Antarctic Ice Sheet's inception (34 million years ago) to the present. Key objectives include addressing the evolution and uplift of the Marie Byrd Land hotspot, investigating the interplay of mantle processes and tectonic forces during rift evolution in the West Antarctic Rift System, and evaluating how buoyancy-driven mantle flow interacts with glacial isostatic adjustment. The model will provide critical boundary conditions, including heat flow and topographic changes, for improved ice sheet and glacier modeling. This work will also contribute to understanding the interactions between the solid Earth and the climate system. \r\n\r\nAntarctica\u2019s vast ice sheet sits on a continent shaped by deep Earth processes that have influenced its landscape over millions of years. This project uses advanced computer simulations to study how slow-moving mantle rock beneath Antarctica affects the ground beneath the ice and interacts with tectonic forces and the climate system. By combining seismic imaging data with cutting-edge modeling techniques, researchers will recreate the history of these processes, starting from when Antarctica first became covered in ice 34 million years ago. The work will help answer questions about why some parts of the continent are rising, how tectonic forces shaped its rift systems, and how the Earth responds to changes in ice sheet size. Results will improve predictions of future sea level rise by providing better estimates of how the ground beneath the ice changes. The project also aims to make scientific tools freely available and increase diversity in polar science by supporting early-career scientists. This research will not only uncover Antarctica\u2019s past but also contribute to understanding its future in a warming world. Broader dissemination will occur through collaborations with the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR) INStabilities and Thresholds in ANTarctica (INSTANT) program, alongside open-source contributions to the ASPECT mantle convection code.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
