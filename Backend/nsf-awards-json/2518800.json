 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description:\r\nQuantum materials in which electron-electron interactions play a significant role are poised to revolutionize future technologies such as spintronics and quantum computation. Over the past few decades, an explosion of research activity has led to the discovery of numerous new quantum materials and exotic quantum phenomena in both correlated systems and beyond, including topological quantum materials, topological superconductors, excitons, and more. A new type of quantum material with a kagome lattice\u2014composed of corner-sharing triangles forming hexagons in the crystal structure\u2014has emerged as promising platforms for exploring the interplay among geometry, topology, electronic correlations, magnetism, and charge density orders. The kagome lattice gives rise to an electronic band structure featuring distinctive characteristics such as topological Dirac, Weyl, or nodal phases, van Hove singularities (vHSs), and flat bands. When relativistic spin-orbit coupling is introduced, these systems often exhibit nontrivial band topology, resulting in edge states that exist exclusively at the material boundaries. The research activities are inherently interdisciplinary, fostering collaboration between experimental and theoretical condensed matter physics. Graduate and undergraduate students participating in the project will gain valuable experience in materials characterization, vacuum technology, laser and synchrotron-based spectroscopy, and ultrafast science. These skills will prepare them to become the next generation of researchers equipped to tackle complex challenges in both academic and industrial settings. Outreach efforts will further inspire interest in quantum materials research by showcasing its transformative potential in addressing global challenges related to energy, computation, and sustainability.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nDespite significant progress in the study of various kagome metals, the exploration of distorted kagome lattices remains relatively unexplored. These materials exhibit structural distortions that break inversion symmetry, thereby modulating electron correlations, magnetic interactions, and band topology. This project aims to investigate lattice distortion as an additional tuning parameter in kagome systems. To achieve this, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), time-resolved ARPES, theoretical modeling, and transport measurements will be employed to study how such distortions affect the electronic properties of these materials. The proposed distorted kagome materials exhibit a range of exotic properties that significantly impact condensed matter physics and hold strong potential to revolutionize low-power electronics and quantum computation. The project will explore how flat bands near the Fermi level respond to external perturbations, the evolution of electron-electron interactions on ultrafast timescales, and the emergence of transient topological states. The outcomes will advance fundamental understanding and support the development of adaptive, multifunctional materials for future technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
