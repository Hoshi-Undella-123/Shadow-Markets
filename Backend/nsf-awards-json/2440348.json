 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) grant supports research aimed at transforming the monitoring of critical infrastructure, such as wind turbines and bridges, by developing new methods to measure three-dimensional structural vibrations using aerial stereovision techniques. This approach seeks to overcome the limitations of traditional structural health monitoring methods, which typically require sensors to be directly placed on the targeted structure and rely on stationary camera setups. By utilizing drone technology paired with advanced computer vision and image processing techniques, this research intends to enable detailed and remote assessments of the dynamic response of large-scale structures. The resulting metrological framework intends to allow for precise quantification of displacement, deformation, and vibrations, enabling early identification of potential damage and extending the operational life of critical infrastructure. The grant also supports educational goals by offering hands-on training, mentorship, and workshops for undergraduate students and individuals seeking to transition into engineering-related careers. These initiatives are designed to create opportunities for all interested Americans by developing practical skills in advanced sensing technologies and structural health monitoring in support of workforce readiness and career advancement.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to advance and validate a framework for drone-based stereovision measurements in structural dynamics, addressing fundamental challenges in stereo camera calibration, feature extraction, and camera motion compensation. Key contributions include (1) developing a correlation function to track inherent structural features\u2014such as bolts or rust\u2014between the left and right views of the stereo cameras with sub-pixel accuracy; (2) reformulating calibration procedures to accommodate time-varying camera positions; and (3) expanding motion magnification techniques to capture subtle displacements in three dimensions. These innovations intend to enable precise structural health monitoring in real-world scenarios where both the structure and the stereo cameras are in motion, enhancing the ability to capture the three-dimensional dynamic behavior of large systems and leading to improvements in engineering practices for condition monitoring and maintenance. Beyond structural health monitoring, this research has potential applications in environmental sciences for tracking geological phenomena (e.g., volcanism, landslides, and glacier ablation) and in medical diagnostics (e.g., detecting subtle tremors in neurological conditions).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
