 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project that helps make scientific research more understandable, shareable, and reusable. Scientists use complex instruments - such as multi-million-dollar microscopes - to collect data in fields such as biology, physics, and environmental science. However, key details about how those instruments were set up or used are often missing. That makes it difficult for others to replicate experiments or build upon the results. The project addresses this challenge by creating clear, standardized records of the equipment used in research. These records, known as Persistent Hardware Descriptors (PHDs), are stored permanently and can be directly linked to scientific data and publications. This makes it easier for others to trust, verify, and reuse that data. By collaborating with equipment manufacturers and developing user-friendly tools for researchers, Imaging-PHD enables scientists to maintain more accurate records with minimal effort. It also offers training and resources so people can learn how to manage and share their data more effectively. Imaging-PHD helps students, early-career researchers, and institutions of all sizes take part in cutting-edge research without needing to repeat expensive experiments. By making scientific tools and data more accessible and trustworthy, the project helps drive innovation, education, and progress.\r\n\r\nThe Imaging-PHD project is building a scalable cyberinfrastructure framework to capture, store, and disseminate persistent and machine-actionable metadata describing microscopy hardware configurations at the time of data acquisition. This work addresses a significant barrier to scientific rigor, reproducibility, and data reuse by ensuring that complex, evolving instrument setups are permanently and accurately recorded. The project\u2019s primary goals are to persistently identify instrument models by leveraging the CoreMarketplace/Research Resource Identifiers (RRID) infrastructure; assign Persistent Identifiers (PID) to individual instrument instances; introduce Persistent Hardware Descriptors (PHDs) - fault-tolerant, and distributed, metadata records that provide citable, persistent descriptions of complex and evolving instrument hardware; automate and standardize metadata capture through vendor-friendly and community-driven frameworks that minimize manual entry and errors; and engage and educate the research community and instrument manufacturers in adopting standardized metadata practices. While initially focused on microscopy, the approach is designed for extensibility across other domains, including biology, physics, earth sciences, and other fields of engineering. Imaging-PHD advances reproducibility, automates metadata capture, and creates infrastructure for machine-readable, publication-linked metadata across disciplines. The project facilitates access to complex instrumentation, supports training in metadata best practices, promotes transparency, and enables the development of sustainable, interoperable research infrastructure critical for innovation.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems  in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
