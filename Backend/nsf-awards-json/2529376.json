 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to establish American Computer Science Education Researchers as world leaders in the study of computing education. This project will provide support to American computing science education researchers, practitioners, and graduate students to help offset the cost of attending the Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Global Computing Education Conference (CompEd). SIGCSE created ACM CompEd to provide computing science educators with the opportunity to collaborate with and meet new colleagues in countries other than North America and Europe. By making the cost of attendance more affordable, more Americans will be able to share research results in computer science education and collaborate with faculty from around the globe.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide travel support to approximately fifty US participants. By providing American faculty, postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students with the ability to interact and establish partnerships with academics from outside America, new research opportunities and collaborations will be developed, establishing American Researchers as leaders in the field. Graduate students will benefit from the opportunity to work both with foreign graduate students and other computing education researchers. Undergraduate computing students will benefit both from the innovations that get discovered/developed as well as from the opportunities to work on exciting and innovative projects in computing education. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
