 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports US-based participants in the 21st International Conference on Permutation Patterns, which will be held in July 2025 at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Permutation patterns is the area of research in mathematics and computer science that studies how small patterns can occur as parts of larger patterns, particularly in rearrangements of objects in a line.  There are applications in biology, particularly in the study of DNA rearrangements and amino acid sequences. This conference is part of a series that has been held annually since 2003 (with virtual substitutes during the COVID pandemic), rotating mostly between different institutions in North America and Europe. Each year, the conference features two plenary talks and approximately thirty-five contributed talks, providing researchers with the opportunity to present and discuss their results, while also offering newcomers to the study of permutation patterns a broad perspective on the subject as a whole.  This year, there will also be an introductory workshop aimed at graduate students.  The conference offers a platform for collaboration between junior and senior researchers. There will be time set aside for open problems to be discussed by the entire community. The conference attracts broad participation, including significant numbers of faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions. \r\n\r\nThe conferences will feature research on permutation patterns and their applications. Permutation patterns is an interdisciplinary area with roots in both theoretical computer science and combinatorics. Major themes include the structural properties of permutation classes, asymptotic behavior from both enumerative and probabilistic points of view, extremal questions, algorithmic and decidability questions, and automated theorem proving and discovery. There are applications to other areas of mathematics and computer science as well as to biology. The conference website is at https://sites.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/pp25/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
