 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cyberinfrastructure Alliance for Oregon (CIAO) is a collaboration across Oregon's eight public universities and Link Oregon, the statewide, non-profit optical network. This project facilitates the development of a statewide strategic cyberinfrastructure (CI) plan to revolutionize the research landscape in Oregon. Building on a strong partnership with Link Oregon, the Oregon Regional Computing Accelerator at Portland State University (NSF Award #2346732), and a committed statewide research computing group, this plan increases capability for world-class research, addresses current limitations to access to CI resources at smaller institutions, and supports educational programs to build a skilled workforce for Oregon. This project is designed to boost research productivity across the state, enable Oregon to support U.S. leadership in science and engineering, and provide a model that could be applied in other states to address strategic CI needs.\r\n\r\nThis project outlines a shared vision, values, and goals to guide future investments in CI, aligning efforts across the state and empowering institutions to execute strategically. The plan 1) facilitates regional collaboration and data sharing, 2) fosters a community of practice for research IT professionals, and 3) develops the CI Strategic Plan for Oregon. Key activities include campus visits, data collection, and statewide workshops to strengthen regional and multi-disciplinary collaboration, workforce development, and expansion of research computing capabilities across Oregon's public universities. CIAO will work with campus leaders, research IT leaders, an external advisory board with national expertise, and university leadership on developing, reviewing, approving, and disseminating the strategic plan.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
