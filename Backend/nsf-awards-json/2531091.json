 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) MobiCom 2025, will be held in Hong Kong, China on November 4 - 8, 2025.  This is the 31st in a series of annual conferences sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE dedicated to addressing emerging challenges in the core areas of mobile computing and wireless networking.  As a top-tier conference, the ACM MobiCom conference attracts significant research contributions that address important research and builds practical working systems, spanning in a wide range of research areas. Moreover, the ACM MobiCom conference features a single-track technical program, where all the accepted high-quality peer-reviewed papers are presented to the entire audience, fostering a sense of community and cohesive experience with interaction and discussion around same core information and common contents.   \r\n\r\nThis project supports students from US universities to attend ACM MobiCom 2025 in person. Students will have the opportunity to present their work and be exposed to state-of-the-art developments in the field. They will also have the opportunity to interact with peers from institutions worldwide, meet with senior researchers, and participate in discussions that are likely to shape the future of the field. This grant will target graduate students who will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited travel funds. Priority will be given to first-time attendees.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
