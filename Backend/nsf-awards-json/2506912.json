 "awd_abstract_narration": "The shift to online and hybrid learning has exposed critical limitations in existing virtual STEM laboratories, particularly their inability to replicate the hands-on, collaborative experiences essential for deep science learning. Traditional labs provide embodied and communicative interactions that are often absent in current online tools \u2013 especially in experiments involving delicate, dangerous, or spatially complex procedures. This project will address that gap by developing immersive virtual reality (VR) laboratory environments that feature realistic avatars and tactile feedback, enabling collaborative learning that mirrors the cognitive and social dynamics of physical labs. By advancing access to high-quality science education, the project supports national goals to enhance health, prosperity, and workforce development. Approximately 500 students and 50 teachers will be directly impacted through outreach and implementation efforts with the aim of equipping learners with the skills necessary for future scientific and technical careers and to increase the overall STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThe project will investigate how immersive VR laboratories, enhanced with high-fidelity avatars and vibrotactile interfaces, support collaborative science learning. A key research objective will be to examine how variations in avatar visual realism and tactile interactivity influence conceptual understanding, procedural competence, emotional engagement, and collaboration. The central hypothesis is that increased embodiment and realism will improve both individual and team-based learning outcomes. Technological development will focus on reconstructing avatars with full-body fidelity and embedding sensory feedback systems that simulate real-world lab interactions. The research will include controlled user studies in chemistry, comparing learning and collaboration outcomes in VR labs versus traditional in-person labs. Data collection will include quantitative measures such as pre/post-tests and interaction performance metrics, alongside qualitative observations, interviews, and surveys. Analysis will involve both statistical and thematic techniques to capture the cognitive, affective, and collaborative impacts of immersive learning. The project will culminate in the release of an open-source VR lab platform and accompanying dataset, enabling broader access and seeding future innovations in collaborative online STEM education. \r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Research on Innovative Technologies for Enhanced Learning (RITEL) program that supports early-stage exploratory research in emerging technologies for teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
