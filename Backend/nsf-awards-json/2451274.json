 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance structural DNA nanotechnology by developing a next-generation software platform for designing DNA origami nanostructures. DNA origami enables precise nanoscale assembly with applications in drug delivery, biosensing, materials science, and molecular computing. However, existing design tools often require researchers to use multiple disconnected applications, leading to inefficiencies in research and development. By streamlining the design-build-test-learn cycle, this technology has the potential to reduce development time and costs, accelerating the path to market for DNA origami-based innovations. The platform will be commercialized through a tiered software-as-a-service model, ensuring accessibility for academic researchers while providing robust solutions for industry users. The initial target market includes academic institutions, biotechnology startups, and pharmaceutical companies engaged in DNA nanotechnology. The broader impact of this project includes fostering scientific discovery, enabling new applications in nanotechnology, and supporting advancements in healthcare, materials science, and photonic technologies.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on developing a computer-aided design application for DNA origami nanostructures, addressing key limitations in existing software. The research will emphasize user interface improvements and the development of features that support the entire lifecycle of DNA origami design, from initial modeling to experimental validation. Through iterative prototyping and testing, the project will evaluate the technical feasibility of a comprehensive design platform that facilitates advanced DNA nanostructure engineering. The team will create interactive prototypes to demonstrate core functionality and gather feedback from potential users. Success will be measured by the development of multiple functional user interface prototypes and the demonstration of the platform\u2019s ability to streamline complex DNA origami design tasks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
