 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Single Cell Approaches in Plant Biology Gordon Research Conference (GRC) with its associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), is an international scientific conference focused on advancing the frontiers of science through the presentation of cutting-edge and unpublished research, prioritizing time for discussion after each talk and fostering informal interactions among scientists of all career stages through evening poster sessions and communal meals. Plant biology has important practical implications for society, including a major role in agriculture through its impact on plant defense and yield, as well as applications in biotechnology. The Single Cell Approaches in Plant Biology GRS provides a unique forum for doctoral and post-doctoral researchers to present their research as well as to build collaborative relationships with their peers. This seminar aims to provide a platform to explore molecular interactions within individual cells to the larger physiological functions driving plant growth and adaptation to the environment, highlighting the latest technologies on molecular biology of individual cells. The two-day seminar offers a conducive environment for participants to present their research, engage in stimulating discussions on innovative concepts, and establish collaborative relationships with their peers. This GRS includes a career mentoring discussion panel designed to offer insights and guidance from experienced mentors on navigating the journey from academic training to professional roles in science.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of both GRS and GRC are 1) to advance our understanding of spatial organization of biological molecules, gene expression, and cellular processes across plant cells and their effects on plant responses, and 2) to grow and support the scientific community working in this research area.  Many new technologies have revolutionized biology, including advances in high resolution imaging, in vivo protein interactions, computational modeling, and single-cell analyses. These technologies are being applied to plants to dissect the functions and interactions of specialized cell types and their capacity to respond to environmental changes, interact with other organisms, grow, and reproduce. The information provided by these new technologies needs to be shared and integrated to provide fresh insights into the functional connections among diverse biomolecules, suggest new hypotheses for cellular functions, and to model cellular processes. The GRC program includes speakers and discussion leaders from institutions and organizations worldwide, concentrating on the latest developments in the field. The conference is five days long and offers oral presentations, poster sessions from individuals of all career stages, and informal networking opportunities with leaders in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
