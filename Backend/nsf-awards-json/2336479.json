 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic Ocean ecosystem is changing with warming temperatures and declining sea ice. The Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) project will observe these changes in the northern Bering and Chukchi Seas. Sampling locations are biologically important and are in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. Other investigators from the USA and several partner countries will sample the same locations multiple times a year on a cooperative basis. This will provide expanded and cost-effective data collection during different seasons and conditions. Data collected will include environmental conditions such as the water column characteristics and the sea floor animals that are food for whales, seals, walrus and seabirds. Data will be shared and available for public use as soon as is practical. The project will contribute to the current U.S. National Ocean Policy and the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee\u2019s 5-year plan. The data will be of value to U.S. and international science and management agencies, private industry, and local communities as they try to understand and adapt to changes in the Arctic. The project will also support training for three graduate students and opportunities for undergraduate research experiences.\r\n\r\nDBO observations will be collected annually through an array of strategies deployed via shipboard, autonomous, laboratory, and satellite platforms. An annual transit of a Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker will serve as the core flagship for DBO sampling. The observations performed will include standard hydrographic and biological measurements along five transect lines that represent zones of high biological productivity and biodiversity. Sampling locations in each transect will be arrayed south-to-north and reflect a gradient of seasonal sea ice change and seawater warming. Satellite observations will also be used to evaluate seasonal changes in sea ice concentration, surface seawater temperature, and chlorophyll concentrations. Collectively, these measurements will extend a marine time-series that previously has revealed a freshening and warming of Pacific seawater and impacts on prey for larger marine mammals, seabirds and probably fish and shellfish. This research will increase our understanding of impacts on biological communities as key environmental conditions change. The use of biological data to determine the status of prey-predator relationships along with physical and chemical measurements will allow for better understanding of changing conditions and that in turn promote a better understanding of the Arctic Ocean and surrounding ecosystems. This project will also connect the offshore DBO where shipboard measurements are made with existing local community-based observations, as well as build connections to a newly formed DBO network that is being implemented by other countries around the Arctic.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
