 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for three Annual Geometry Festivals, the first taking place at Duke University in the Spring of 2026, and the second and third taking place at the University of Maryland and at Stonybrook University.  The conferences will cover major recent accomplishments and outstanding problems in geometry to a wide audience of interested students and faculty. This conference will be beneficial to graduate students, early career mathematicians, and advanced undergraduate math majors. \r\n \r\nThe conference will bring together geometers covering a wide swatch of fields. Topics covered will include differential geometry, partial differential equations and numerical analysis, algebraic geometry, spectral geometry, geometric and harmonic analysis, dynamical systems and mathematical physics.   Speakers were selected not only for their subject expertise, but also for their ability help engage younger geometers and bring them up to speed in current areas of research, and to encourage interaction and collaboration amongst researchers at a variety of career stages.   Here is a URL for the initial iteration of the conferences: https://sites.google.com/view/geometry-festival-duke-2026.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
