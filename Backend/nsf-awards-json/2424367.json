 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Algebraic Geometry Northeastern Series (AGNES) is a series of biannual conferences in the field of algebraic geometry. The conference is hosted on a rotating basis by an association of universities in the Northeast region. This award supports six AGNES conferences, which will be held at Dartmouth College on November 8-10, 2024, at Rutgers University in Spring 2025, at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in Fall 2025, at Stony Brook University in Spring 2026, at Brown University in Fall 2026, and at the University of Pennsylvania in Spring 2027. Each AGNES conference has two goals. First, each conference promotes the dissemination of cutting-edge research in mathematics. The centerpiece of each conference is a series of research lectures by top mathematicians; there are also educational talks for graduate students and events which promote new collaborations or development of peer relationships. \r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry is a field in the mathematical sciences concerned with solution sets of polynomial equations. It has deep connections to many other areas of pure mathematics, such as topology, arithmetic, number theory, differential geometry, dynamical systems, and homological algebra. At the same time algebraic geometry has found important applications in many subdisciplines of applied mathematics, including cryptography, complexity theory, mathematical biology, and computer vision. The scientific scope of AGNES is greatly enriched by lectures from neighboring mathematical subjects, such as arithmetic geometry, dynamics, complex geometry, and computational geometry. Further information about conference events can be found at the website: http://www.agneshome.org/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
