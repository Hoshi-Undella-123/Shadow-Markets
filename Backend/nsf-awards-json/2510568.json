 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mergers of ultra-compact stellar remnants called neutron stars have now been observed.  They provide new tools to study general relativity, compact objects, neutron star equation of state, plasma physics, astrophysical jet physics, and nucleosynthesis. A joint US-Israeli research team will develop numerical simulations of binary mergers through their full development. The US effort is jointly led by California State University, Sacramento, Purdue University, and Northwestern University. The team will aim to construct \u201cmeter-to-parsec\u201d models of binary mergers, which follow through the entire journey of length and time scale, by directly connecting the pre-merger state of a neutron star - neutron star (NS-NS) or neutron star - black hole (NS-BH) binary to the regions where the observed photons are produced. This project has two main broader societal impacts : (i) Development of a globally competitive STEM workforce; and (ii) Improvement of STEM education of K-12 students.\r\n\r\nThe models will allow interpretation of various observables of the system by connecting them with the conditions inside the ejecta and in the pre-merger phase: (i) Generating consistent models of the jet profile will allow the researchers to connect the observed off-axis emission to the conditions at the base of the jet and help construct reliable emission models for the multi-wavelength counterparts of gravitational wave events. (ii) To date, it is still not known if the compact merger remnants powering short gamma-ray bursts (sGRB) jets are BHs or NSs. By mapping the main differences between the physical properties and emission profiles of jets powered by these two types of engines, the research will provide a method to distinguish between them, independent of the kilonova emission, which may not be detectable in typical multi-messenger events. (iii) The question of energy composition in the jet at large scales is a long standing puzzle in sGRBs. The answer can shed light on the acceleration mechanisms and emission processes responsible for the prompt gamma-rays. In addition, the Sacramento State principal investigator (PI) will partner with the Sacramento State planetarium to develop a new curriculum for K-5 audiences that visit the planetarium as part of their free school field trips. The Purdue PI will partner with the Saturday Morning Astrophysics Purdue program for middle and high-school students to develop and lead an annual session on the detection of gravitational waves and the study of compact objects in the Universe. The Northwestern PI will partner with the REACH high school program to mentor Chicago-area high school students each summer.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
