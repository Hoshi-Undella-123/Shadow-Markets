 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides participant support for US students to attend the Second World Congress on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management (IEOM), to be held in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, 14-16 October 2025. The congress will focus on cutting-edge research and development in artificial intelligence (AI) applications in manufacturing and the digital transformation of the manufacturing supply chain, particularly in response to the current global uncertainties. The conference brings together academic researchers and industry practitioners to share innovations in smart manufacturing, supply chain resilience, and AI integration through oral presentations, poster sessions, and technical competitions. Participation in this congress will support the development of a globally aware STEM workforce, equipping students with insights into the challenges and opportunities in digital manufacturing and smart technologies.\r\n\r\nThe congress will address future manufacturing capabilities, including Industry 4.0, Internet of Things (IoT), simulation, vehicle electrification, automation, and sustainable supply chains. Students will gain valuable experience by participating in technical competitions, presenting their research, and engaging in professional networking with U.S. and international academic and industry practitioners and leaders. The conference is expected to have a significant impact on various sectors, including manufacturing, transportation, and electronics. This participant support contributes to the scientific, technical, and professional growth of students, preparing them for leadership roles in the evolving landscape of manufacturing and operations management.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
