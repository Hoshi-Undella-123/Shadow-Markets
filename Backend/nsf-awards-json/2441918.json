 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will support research that looks to develop a sustainable wood protection system using a naturally derived, environmentally friendly antimicrobial compound\u2014epsilon-polylysine (EPL). The project seeks to address the urgent need for safer, more sustainable alternatives to conventional wood preservatives, such as copper-based treatments, which pose environmental and health risks due to their toxicity and leaching behavior. The proposed research contributes to national interests by working to advance green building materials that promote long-term carbon storage and reduce infrastructure maintenance costs. This work also aligns with the NSF mission by increasing the understanding of how EPL interacts with the wood system and enhancing national well-being through innovation in sustainable infrastructure. Additionally, the project integrates impactful educational initiatives that engage K\u201312, undergraduate, and graduate students, aiming to inspire the next generation of Wood Science and Engineering (WSE) professionals. By combining cutting-edge research with broad educational outreach, this CAREER project fosters scientific advancement and workforce development to support a more resilient and sustainable future.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop a new wood preservative system, where a bio-based preservative (EPL biosynthesized by bacteria Streptomyces albulus) with broad biological activities but low environmental hazards will be valorized and used for wood treatment induced by Maillard reaction. The specific aims are to 1) determine key factors that affect the durability of EPL-treated wood induced by the Maillard reaction for exterior applications; 2) understand the long-term durability, mechanical and fire performance of EPL-treated wood through summer Build & Learn experience for real applications; 3) elucidate antimicrobial mechanisms of EPL-treated wood; 4) examine sustainability of EPL-treated wood via ecotoxicity tests, economic and environmental viability analysis; 5) integrate sustainable wooden infrastructure material protection research with experiential learning and near-peer mentoring to engage students, from local middle school and high school students to graduate students, and cultivate interest in the field of Wood Science and Engineering and beyond. This work will lay the foundation for a new class of green, bio-based wood protection technologies and contribute significantly to sustainable and resilient wooden infrastructure materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
