 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Texas A&M University, located in College Station, TX, will support the training of 11 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2025-2027. The program will expose participants to research into the molecular and cellular basis of life, which is the backbone of biomedical research and has many applications in chemical industries. Participants can choose among research laboratories focusing on drug discovery, enzymology, gene regulation, plant biochemistry and genetics, cell biology, microbiology, quantitative biology, or structural biology. In addition to acquiring specialized knowledge and technical skills within a research laboratory, participants will learn about a wide range of topics and approaches in biochemistry through an introductory lab experience, facilities tours, and group discussions. Exposing students to the breadth of biochemistry research will enable them to make informed decisions about specializing in a subfield of biochemistry and prepare them for graduate school and careers in scientific research. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done through surveys that evaluate the development of scientific skills, interest in research careers, and entrance into graduate school or science-related careers after graduation. Students should apply to the REU site using NSF ETAP (Education and Training Application: https://etap.nsf.gov).\r\n\r\nThe theme of this REU program is biochemistry writ large. In contrast to many colleges and universities that incorporate biochemistry into Chemistry or Biology departments, the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Texas A&M is an independent department that spans all of biochemistry, from physical biochemistry to molecular genetics of multicellular organisms. Recent projects include optimizing purification and phosphorylation of the protein ubiquitin for NMR spectroscopy, using cell and molecular biology to determine the role of mitochondria-disease related proteins in assembling the electron transport chain, and employing bacterial genetics to understand the production and function of an iron-binding pigment. Students will be embedded in faculty research labs and participate in weekly professional development workshops focusing on career development, responsible conduct of research, communication skills, and applying for graduate school and fellowships. Students will receive constructive comments throughout the summer to aid the development of analytical and communication skills. At the end of the summer, students will present their project at the Biochemistry REU Symposium and write a paper describing their research project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
