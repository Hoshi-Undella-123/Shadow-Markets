 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science gateways are used by hundreds of thousands of researchers and students, supporting both publication-quality science and at-scale education. Science gateways involve research domains such as biomedical research, energy security, responsible AI development, and supply chain resilience. Gateways 2025 is the major event for the science gateway community in the US to discuss challenges and solutions, to identify new issues, to shape future directions for research, to foster exchange of ideas, standards and common requirements, and to support wider adoption of science gateways. Travel grants play a crucial role for students and early-career researchers by facilitating their access to expert knowledge and mentorship through conference sessions and networking opportunities.\r\n\r\nGateways 2025 features various program formats such as keynotes, presentations, tutorials, demos, panels, posters and Bring Your Own Portal. Accepted submissions are published in open-access proceedings and accepted papers are invited to a special issue in a journal. The travel grant allows more students and early-career researchers to participate at Gateways 2025 and gives them access to expert knowledge and mentorship through conference sessions and networking opportunities.  The topics covered by the Gateways conference series range from technical topics to use cases to related content such as usability or sustainability of science gateways. The building blocks of science gateway frameworks are re-usable in a broad range of research areas, as evident in widely used frameworks such as Hubzero and Tapis. The Gateways conference series sets the stage for learning, engaging and empowering the different stakeholders in the community who are science gateway users, developers and providers as well as funders and decision makers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
