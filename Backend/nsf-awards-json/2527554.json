 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of carbon fiber derived from waste gas carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon fiber is widely used in industries including aerospace, automotive, and energy generation due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, which boosts both fuel efficiency and performance. Advances in additive manufacturing have enabled the use of carbon dioxide as the feedstock for carbon fiber production, eliminating the need for the expensive polymer precursor used by industry incumbents. This new production method significantly reduces the production temperature from ~1000\u00b0C (polyacrylonitrile-derived carbon fibers) to ~750\u00b0C (carbon dioxide-derived carbon fiber), allowing for a significant reduction in the production cost of carbon fiber. The new product is nearing the performance specs of popular chopped carbon fiber offerings, while significantly reducing production costs. In addition to being both cost competitive and carbon negative, this new method of producing carbon fiber through the utilization of advances in additive manufacturing has the potential to significantly increase the U.S. domestic production of carbon fiber, adding supply chain security. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a novel process that converts carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) into high-performance carbon fiber using molten carbonate electrolysis. The system electrolytically reduces CO\u2082 gas\u2014sourced from industrial waste streams or direct air capture\u2014into solid elemental carbon at the cathode, while oxygen evolves at the anode. By controlling current density, electrolysis potential, and electrolyte composition, the process enables the deposition of aligned carbon structures suitable for fiber extrusion. These carbon deposits are continuously drawn from the melt using a liquid-metal-assisted nozzle, allowing control over fiber diameter, morphology, and mechanical properties. Scientific advances in high-temperature electrochemistry, cathode surface engineering, and phase-selective carbon growth enable the formation of a graphitic carbon aligned along the draw axis. The resulting material exhibits tunable modulus and strength characteristics, targeting applications in composites, lightweight structures, and conductive media. By turning CO\u2082\u2014a waste product of several industrial processes\u2014into a valuable structural material, this technology offers both economic and environmental benefits. This transformative approach redefines carbon fiber manufacturing for aerospace, automotive, and industrial markets.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
