 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a conference on \u201cA Celebration of the Science Legacy of Joanne Chory,\u201d to be held July 25-26, 2025 at the Baird Convention Center, Milwaukee, WI.  This meeting will be attended by graduate students, postdocs, and junior and senior faculty researchers from all areas of plant biology to discuss and advance our understanding of the physiology, structure, and interactions of plant cells, especially the responses to light, responses to hormones, and formation growth, and function of chloroplasts.  The conference will also discuss advances in plant cell biotechnology applications.  The interactions of plant physiologists, geneticists, and cell biologists will increase our understanding of plants.  The speakers presenting the talks are all former students or collaborators with Dr. Chory, and will engage with junior scientists to help them develop successful scientific research careers.\r\n\r\n   This meeting will be attended by graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior and senior researchers to discuss our understanding of all aspects of plant cell biology and response.  Sessions will focus on recent advances in such topics as \u201cLight and Temperature Signaling\u201d, \u201cOrganelle Signaling and Dynamics\u201d, \u201cAuxin and Shade Avoidance\u201d and \u201cBrassinosteroids\u201d  In addition to formal talks, engagement will be facilitated by discussions stimulate interactions between researchers.  NSF support will be used solely to defray registration costs to allow attendance of participants from early stages of their careers.\r\n\r\n   This award is funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
