 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neuromodulation implants such as spinal cord stimulators and vagus nerve stimulators have the potential to treat a wide range of conditions, including chronic pain, movement disorder, and organ dysfunction. These technologies can significantly improve quality of life for people with injuries or neurological diseases. However, the high cost and complexity of developing such devices greatly limits the development of new therapies, especially for patients with rare diseases. To help address these challenges, the Center for Autonomic Recording and Stimulation Systems (CARSS) was formed to develop and share open-source neurotechnology devices that can be used for research, clinical trials, and the commercialization of new therapies. CARSS resulted in the development of OpenNerve, a neuromodulation implant and a set of compatible sensors and stimulators, with designs released online under an open-source copyright license. Collaborations and outreach to researchers aim to test new therapies in preclinical trials. This effort seeks to formalize a community that works together to address serious diseases using neuromodulation device technology and eventually to advance these into clinical use.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) Phase 1 project is to better understand and document the needs and opportunities in open-source neuromodulation through interviews with physicians, researchers, and entrepreneurs who are developing neurotechnology, as well as individuals with experience in open-source medical technology. This project engages with these communities through individual interviews and group workshops where potential users can interact with the resources CARSS is developing and give direct feedback. The results of the community engagement will guide the development of a sustainable governance structure for CARSS, including transparent governance and clear protocols for accepting design changes developed by outside contributors while still ensuring patient safety and device functionality. Ultimately, establishing a robust open-source ecosystem will accelerate innovation in neuromodulation devices and expand access to life-changing therapies for patients who currently have limited treatment options.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
