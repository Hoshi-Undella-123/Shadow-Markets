 "awd_abstract_narration": "From the hierarchy of search engine results that dictate the ease with which we find information, to the curated news and social media that we view, and the prioritized online contacts forming our social and professional networks, learning to rank (LTR) is an indispensable mechanism. Beyond meeting routine information needs of general users, LTR is also essential in supporting specialized decision makings, such as filtering healthcare documents for diagnostics or prioritizing legal documents in legal practices. Hence, ensuring that these rankings are trustworthy, by making the reasoning process transparent, ensuring ranking distribution balanced across different users and items, and maintaining robustness in unpredictable real-world conditions, is of paramount importance. Current approaches, however, often address superficial symptoms while overlooking fundamental causes, leading to limited effectiveness, compromised transparency, and thus eroded usability and credibility. The objective of this project is to leverage neuro-symbolic learning to develop novel ranking algorithms with inherently interpretable reasoning processes. The integration of expressiveness in deep learning and transparency in symbolic reasoning presents a compelling avenue to synergistically capitalize on the merits of both realms. Moreover, owing to the innate transparency of neuro-symbolic ranking models, these models readily identify factors within the reasoning process that lead to various prediction imbalance and safety issues. Uncovering and investigating these elements enlightens more effective, holistic, and transparent approaches toward balanced and robust ranking systems.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to forge novel neuro-symbolic learning to rank models to deliver interpretable, balanced, and robust rankings through four thrusts. The first thrust introduces a logic neural network that transparently elucidates the entire inference process in ranking and presents a logic AutoEncoder, a type of artificial neural network for efficient coding, for interpretable collaborative filtering rankings. Moreover, a neuro-symbolic representation learning technique is proposed to enhance model expressiveness and accuracy. Second, this project proposes to utilize the inherent transparency in neuro-symbolic ranking algorithms as key tools, to effectively enhance ranking balance for both users and items. Last, this project proposes novel strategies leveraging and augmenting the interpretable reasoning process of neuro-symbolic learning to fortify robustness against shortcut features, exposure differences, and data poisoning attacks. This project will also apply proposed research innovations in two real ranking systems, organ transplantation management and research paper recommendation, to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed technologies in real-world contexts and to ensure the proposed project would be successful with impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
