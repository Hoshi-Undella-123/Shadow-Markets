 "awd_abstract_narration": "X-ray science has been a cornerstone of innovation since its discovery over 125 years ago, contributing to medical advancements, scientific research, and technology development. However, recent breakthroughs in quantum electrodynamics are opening a new era of possibilities for X-ray technology. This project aims to revolutionize X-ray science by developing new nanoscale photonics technologies. The Principal Investigator (PI)'s work holds the potential to bring about major leaps in the life sciences, energy sectors, and various other fields. These advancements could lead to new tools in quantum information science, ultrafast imaging, and spectroscopies that were once considered science fiction.\r\nThis project is not only about advancing technological capabilities but also about promoting the overall progress of science in alignment with NSF\u2019s mission. By integrating various fields such as quantum physics, laser technology, and accelerator science, the PI is setting the stage for novel applications that impact everything from medical imaging to quantum computing. Furthermore, their commitment to develop educational initiatives will foster a new pipeline of future scientists and engineers.\r\nIn summary, this research endeavors to redefine how X-ray technology is utilized in various fields, while simultaneously addressing important educational and societal challenges. Nurturing talent from all segments of society and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration will ensure that the benefits of this research are widespread, enhancing national health, prosperity, and knowledge.\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nThe PI will experimentally validate the production of X-rays via the quantum interference of electrons. This will be achieved by shaping electron wave packets from a true quantum electrodynamic (QED) perspective, enabling us to produce highly directional and monochromatic X-rays with energies reaching up to several tens of keV. The project aims to extend the PI's demonstration to generate attosecond-duration X-ray wave packets, thereby creating extremely bright X-ray pulses. This will be comparable in brightness to those of billion-dollar large-scale X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) facilities but from much more compact radiation sources.\r\nThe methods and approaches are centered around the fusion of QED, laser technology, and advanced accelerator physics techniques. By harnessing the capabilities of QED, the PI aims to provide an ultracompact X-ray source, that reduces both cost and size and features a scalable architecture suitable for integration and portability. This will offer the possibility of achieving on-chip X-ray frequency combs.\r\nThe anticipated contributions of this project include not only the foundational demonstration of novel electron-photon quantum interference but also potential applications in quantum information science. Such applications span from quantum-level semiconductor lithography and ultrafast microscopy to compact XFEL devices and atom-by-atom matter assembly.\r\nOverall, the execution of this project is expected to significantly advance the field of X-ray science and facilitate a new class of radiation sources with broad applicability. By aligning cutting-edge research with interdisciplinary collaboration and education initiatives, this project also sets the groundwork for nurturing the future STEM workforce, and enhancing the technological infrastructure to meet ongoing societal and scientific demands.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
