 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ultimately, people want to feel connected to people on their block, in their neighborhood, and in their city or town. That connection can in large part depend on interpersonal interactions, whether experienced as pleasant or uncomfortable, and these interactions are often shaped by people\u2019s positive or negative attitudes. What is known about attitude formation is largely based on individual experiences and how those individual experiences influence attitude formation. This project advances what is known about attitude formation and attitude changes, by examining how geographic contexts shape the formation of attitudes and influence the quality of interpersonal interactions.\r\n\r\nThis project tests three questions derived from an interdisciplinary mathematical model of attitude formation. This model draws inspiration from social psychology and urban science to explicitly account for interactions at different spatial scales. Specifically, the project tests: (1) How much do attitudes vary across place and spatial scale? (2) How much can the nested contexts of cities and neighborhoods explain about attitude formation? (3) How much variation in attitudes across spatial scales and places is related to the quality of local interpersonal interactions? To support training for students and researchers, the project also includes the development of an online course and a set of example data analysis pipelines demonstrating the application of these methods. This research develops novel integrative methods in attitude research, offering new theoretical frameworks that promote national prosperity and welfare.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by Social Psychology and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
