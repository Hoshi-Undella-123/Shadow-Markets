 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent growth in data-enabled science and engineering has ushered in a promising new generation of cyberinfrastructure (CI) technologies. These technologies use sophisticated features that have propelled the adoption and advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in scientific and engineering research and discovery. While these technologies hold enormous potential to accelerate scientific discovery, their novelty and complexity often present significant barriers to effective use by researchers. This project, ByteBoost 2.0, offers a community-driven unified training platform where interested researchers and instructors can learn to use state-of-the-art sophisticated technologies. The program offers a series of specialized online training events followed by an in-person hands-on researcher-training workshop. The program enables researchers to gain the skills and strategic understanding required to effectively place scientific workflows on cutting-edge CI resources and train the new generation of researchers, accelerating the process of scientific discovery and innovation. \r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding on the lessons learned from a successful Pilot program, the ByteBoost 2.0 training platform advances the goals of familiarizing researchers and educators with advanced novel computing technologies. The program is modular and focuses on common challenges faced by researchers rather than a specific accelerator technology or discipline. The program offers an environment that accommodates interested campus, regional, and national computing technology testbed facilities including NSF-funded advanced cyberinfrastructure resources. The program begins with a webinar series open to a broad audience of computational researchers and instructors. These sessions introduce foundational topics, highlight key distinctions among computing technologies, and incorporate hands-on exercises. All training materials will be maintained in a learning management system. Participating researchers will also get access to existing asynchronous CI-courses to establish a baseline level of knowledge and CI skills.  After the webinars, participants will apply to attend a five-day, in-person \u201cBring Your Own Science\u201d workshop. At the workshop, they will work on a capstone project related to their research. The workshop will include educators who will develop curricular programs in collaboration with educational experts.  During the workshop, all participants will work on their chosen research problems using the innovative technologies. Trained peer-facilitators and experienced scientists will offer recommendations on how to effectively utilize these systems. The community-driven focus helps integrate the innovative CI technologies into the growing research and instructional fabric. Working with active CI-engagement groups, ByteBoost 2.0 will broaden adoption of computation and AI at two- and four-year institutions, contributing to the goals of national AI research, entrepreneurial, and educational initiatives. The program will be offered on an annual basis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
