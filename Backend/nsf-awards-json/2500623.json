 "awd_abstract_narration": "As technology advances at an unprecedented pace, AI stands at the forefront of transformative change across industries, with most organizations expected to use some form of AI by 2028. There is a high demand in the Grand Rapids Community College (GRCC) service region, and nationwide, for technicians with generative artificial intelligence (AI) skills or credentials. To support this demand, the project will update the AI Certificate program by aligning the curriculum with the specialized AI needs of West Michigan's high-demand industries. The enhanced certificate will be stackable into the Computer Information Systems (CIS) Pathway Associate of Arts and Sciences degree or viable as a standalone credential. The primary audience is students at the associate degree level and IT technicians and other professionals seeking an AI credential. Courses in the program will also be accessible to high school students, students in GRCC's non-credit job training programs, and community members. Activities will include the development of educational materials via employer-driven curricular enhancements to two courses in the current curriculum and the creation of four new courses, including a capstone class in which students gain work experience by working in teams that are paired with an employer for a hands- on project that addresses a real-world industry problem. The project will also provide professional development for faculty to equip them with the latest AI knowledge while fostering an educational environment that supports continuous learning and adaptation to new technologies. This project has the potential to support all students, through a partner-centric \"no wrong door\" approach and targeted recruiting. The project will ensure work-ready graduates by enhancing GRCC's AI curricula while generating valuable insights into effective AI education strategies that can shape the academic community\u2019s approach to tech education.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project will be: 1) to increase the number and diversity of AI-skilled technicians capable of meeting the talent needs of West Michigan's highest-demand industries through novel applications of AI in the workplace, and 2) to prepare educators to competently integrate AI usage into the curricula in their respective disciplines. All curricular improvements and new courses will be informed by engaging a minimum of 15 employers on an Industry Advisory Team (IAT) using the Business & Industry Leadership Team (BILT) model, through which industry partners have direct input into the knowledge, skills, and abilities that program graduates will possess upon program completion. Also, at least 10 industry partners will be engaged to work with student teams on a capstone project that deploys AI to solve an identified challenge in their business/workplace. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
