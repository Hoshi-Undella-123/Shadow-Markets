 "awd_abstract_narration": "Similar in some ways to the familiar surface waves, internal gravity waves exist in the interior of a stratified ocean and provide one pathway for the wind energy injected at the surface to reach deeper layers. This project will use theoretical and numerical methods to explore the turbulent mixing generated by internal waves, which is a crucial parameter for more reliable performance of global and regional ocean models. The results of this research will contribute to important practical applications such as the state of climate and securing the national defense. The project will also provide educational opportunities through a summer undergraduate research program and support outreach efforts through museum events and classroom workshops, fostering broader community engagement in ocean science.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to bridge theoretical understanding with realistic ocean scenarios to develop a process-based tool for estimating and parameterizing turbulent dissipation using wave kinetic theory. The research involves a comprehensive evaluation of turbulent dissipation with the inclusion of tidal peaks in the spectrum of internal gravity waves. Computational simulations of internal gravity waves, in both idealized and realistic conditions, will be used to investigate the local interactions, induced diffusion, and elastic scattering in shaping the wave spectrum and downscale energy flux. The expectation is that the work will improve parameterizations of turbulence in terms of measurable characteristics of internal waves.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
