 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a wearable biosensor that continuously measures molecular biomarkers in the human body. Current approaches to biochemical monitoring rely on infrequent sampling and lab-based analysis, which miss rapid changes and provide limited insight into dynamic physiological processes. The technology introduces a new sensing platform that captures real-time biochemical data noninvasively and with high sensitivity. By enabling continuous monitoring, the technology supports advances in health tracking, early disease detection, and personalized care. This approach promotes scientific progress and public well-being by making biochemical information more accessible, timely, and actionable.\r\n \r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of electrochemical biosensors that use structure-switching deoxyribonucleic acid integrated with custom low-power, low-noise complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor circuits. The sensors convert molecular binding events into electrical signals, allowing real-time quantification of multiple biomarkers at relevant concentrations. The platform includes wearable and point-of-care formats designed for small sample volumes and wireless operation. This innovation advances biosensing by combining biochemical specificity with scalable electronics, enabling new applications in longitudinal health monitoring and mobile diagnostics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
