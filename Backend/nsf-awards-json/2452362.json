 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) EPSCoR Graduate Fellowship Program (EGFP) supports EGFP-designated institutions/programs in EPSCoR jurisdictions by providing funding for graduate fellowships for new or continuing EGFP-eligible applicants. EGFP awards support a total of three years of stipend and an associated cost-of-education (COE) allowance for each NSF EPSCoR Graduate Fellow. \r\n\r\nThis award at the University of Southern Mississippi (USM) will support four EPSCoR Graduate Fellows whose research will align with the unique goals and programs supported by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and NSF Office of Integrative Activities (OIA). The project will attract top talent to the School of Polymer Science and Engineering (SPSE) at USM by leveraging its strengths and providing comprehensive training in fundamental knowledge, research capabilities, and professional skills. The proposed research projects will drive innovation in key areas of polymer research, including sustainable materials with controlled thermal and mechanical properties, next-generation soft electronics, biomedical applications, and advanced bio-derived high-performance composites. Aimed to develop future leaders in polymer science and engineering, the proposed program will not only strengthen the research and education capacity of USM but also stimulate economic growth in Mississippi and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis program will recruit four EPSCoR Graduate Fellows for research projects focused on developing carbon dioxide-derived plastics, understanding structure-property relationships of modular conjugated polymers, designing polymeric carriers for enhanced nucleic acid delivery, and fabricating polymer composites using bio-based benzoxazine monomers as renewable feedstocks. These projects are strategically designed to leverage and support key expertise and research programs of SPSE at USM, with the goal of advancing polymer sustainability. Through these projects, graduate student Fellows will gain expertise in materials science and engineering, chemistry, and advanced characterization techniques. The research outcomes have the potential to elevate the role of polymers in healthcare, packaging, energy, and advanced manufacturing, while also driving economic growth and promoting sustainability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
