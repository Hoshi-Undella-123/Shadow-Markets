 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to support student travel at the 2025 IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Body Sensor Networks (BSN 2025). BSN is the premier conference in the areas of sensors and systems for digital health. It will bring together leaders and experts in academia, industry, healthcare, and non-profit organizations to provide a cross-disciplinary, highly selective, and single-track forum for cutting-edge research related to devices and sensors, hardware and software systems, predictive models, and data analytics in the healthcare/medical domains. Student participants will have opportunities to receive professional support and career advice from internationally recognized experts. Travel support increases engagement with the research community and provides professionally significant opportunities to students who might otherwise not be able to attend the conference.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to increase the accessibility of the scientific forum that is BSN 2025. By attending BSN 2025, students may explore their interests, interact and network with seasoned professionals, and identify the various career paths available within the broader community of health scientists and technologists. With this registration award offsetting the cost of attendance, students who would otherwise find attendance expenses prohibitive can obtain these benefits. BSN 2025 will focus on cutting-edge innovations in computational medicine, including applications of novel sensors and artificial intelligence. Increasing student engagement through the reduction of expenses, this award constitutes an investment in the future of the medical sensor research community; a community that is critical to the next generation of healthcare.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
