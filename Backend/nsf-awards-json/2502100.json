 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project supports research that seeks to advance the development of new design methodologies to enhance the structural robustness of 3D-printed parts. Metal additive manufacturing (AM) offers unique advantages in producing complex and lightweight parts, but it also presents challenges\u2014particularly the formation of defects such as porosity. The inherent defects lead to unpredictable quality and degraded performance, highlighting the need for this research project. This research aims to develop new design strategies to ensure high mechanical performance by addressing the presence of defects. Ultimately, the project seeks to advance design for additive manufacturing, bridging the gap between research and practice. The initiative will also support outreach efforts to provide educational opportunities related to metal AM to high school and college students in local communities.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research project is to introduce a novel Defect-Tolerant Design for Additive Manufacturing (DTDAM) that not only minimizes the impact of defects but also enhances the overall robustness of printed parts. Specifically, the research aims to: (1) investigate the impact of different types of porosity defects on the mechanical performance of metal AM parts; (2) establish a strategy for distributing artificial porosity defects within part geometries; (3) develop an innovative defect-tolerant design methodology using a new topology optimization approach that incorporates adapted defect distribution strategies; and (4) validate the methodology across various levels of defect severity. The project seeks to deepen understanding of the interplay between structural geometry and manufacturing defects, establishing a framework for combining experimental data with numerical optimization tools. Furthermore, anticipated advancements will help enhance the practical application of AM technologies, enabling manufacturers to produce more reliable metal AM components.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
