 "awd_abstract_narration": "After recent breakthroughs in quantum error correction, research on quantum computing is entering a new era. Now computer science is more important than ever to the success of quantum computing. We have more exciting algorithms and more qubit technologies than ever, and now we can suppress hardware errors to some degree. In this diverse field, computer science people can devise quantum algorithms and prove limits on what can be achieved, they can design and implement a software stack, and they can formally verify that algorithms and tools work correctly.\r\n\r\nAs a precursor to addressing these challenges, the investigators will host a workshop devoted to identifying the main research challenges in quantum computing. The workshop will bring together researchers from academia, industry, and government research labs working in the area of quantum computing. The main deliverable of the workshop will be a workshop report summarizing the discussions and recommendations made during the meeting.\r\nThe workshop report will inform researchers about new directions in the field and provide a basis upon which next-generation elements of quantum computing can be specified, designed, and implemented.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
