 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2025 Quality and Productivity Research Conference on Statistics in Quality, Industry and Technology (QPRC 2025) will be held in Seattle, Washington from June 15-18, 2025 at the University of Washington. This meeting will be the 41st research conference sponsored by the American Statistical Association (ASA) Section on Quality and Productivity. The theme of QPRC 2025 is \u201cIndustrial Innovation in the Era of AI.\u201d QPRC 2025 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from the world who use statistics in quality, technology, and industrial contexts. The conference promotes communication among researchers and practitioners to enable and ensure the development and widespread use of novel insights and methodology. The conference\u2019s focus is on recent advancements in methodology, best practices and innovative applications. 80-85 conference attendees are anticipated and will have access to three plenary presentations, 18 invited paper sessions, four contributed paper sessions, a technical tour, and a one-day short course.\r\n\r\nParticipation in QPRC 2025 has the potential to advance knowledge and understanding of topics related to data science, statistics, and machine learning, and how they can be relevant for industrial innovation. This conference traditionally attracts prominent statisticians, data scientists, quantitative analysts, and others who have an established record of highly influential, methodological, and interdisciplinary research. These individuals will have the opportunity to discuss the current progress made in statistics and machine learning, such as big data technology, text modeling, the use of generative AI in industrial innovation, and exchange novel ideas and experiences in working with modern data science to discover knowledge and apply it to numerous fields. Hence, this conference has the potential to 1) disseminate new methods and data-driven approaches, the evaluation of previous findings, and the validation of theoretical approaches, 2) stimulate further investigations regarding the benefits of working with statistics and machine learning methods for industry, and 3) increase the awareness of the need to use data science approach in industry. QPRC 2025 is committed to providing an environment where participants from academia and industry will be able to discuss research and ideas. The conference website is https://www.qprc2025.org/ .\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
