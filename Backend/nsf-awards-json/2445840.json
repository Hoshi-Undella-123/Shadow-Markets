 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of next-generation high-speed aerospace systems\u2014including reusable space vehicles and supersonic/hypersonic aircrafts\u2014relies on propulsion systems capable of operating at extremely high speeds. A major barrier to innovation in this domain is the complex and poorly understood behavior of turbulent combustion under high Mach number conditions. These flows involve intricate interactions between turbulence, shock waves, and chemically reacting gases, which make predictive modeling difficult. This project addresses this critical gap by developing advanced simulation tools and experimental data that will improve the accuracy and reliability of combustion models used in aerospace design. By integrating well-resolved simulations with physical experiments, the research promises to transform how engineers understand and predict combustion in extreme conditions. The broader impacts of this project include training graduate and undergraduate students, developing new educational content, and engaging the public through STEM outreach and hands-on learning opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to build a comprehensive framework for modeling turbulent combustion in high-speed flows relevant to scramjets and ramjets. This will be achieved through a three-pronged effort: (i) conducting direct numerical simulations of reactive shear layers to capture key phenomena such as chemical non-equilibrium, multi-component diffusion, and real-gas effects; (ii) initiating an experimental campaign using a shock tube to validate the simulations and replicate real-world flow conditions; and (iii) laying the groundwork for advanced data assimilation techniques that merge experimental and simulation data to enhance large-eddy simulation models. The technical innovations include the use of adjoint and ensemble-variational optimization methods, combined with machine learning, to calibrate and improve predictive models. These efforts will provide a physics-informed, data-driven foundation for designing safer, more efficient propulsion systems. By combining cutting-edge research with educational and outreach components, the project will also support workforce development in STEM and help position the U.S. at the forefront of aerospace innovation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
