 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Advanced Technological Education project aims to serve the national need for a skilled and diverse workforce in geospatial information science and technology (GIST), a rapidly growing field that relies on tools such as global positioning systems, digital mapping software, and data and imagery analysis. These technologies are increasingly essential and provide critical employment opportunities in rural and underserved areas. This project emphasizes the importance of contemporary GIST curricula, highlights the demand for GIST skills in natural and cultural resource careers within Wyoming\u2019s Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, and aims to develop instructional materials. Outcomes include a strengthened student pipeline and robust infrastructure to support paid GIST training in remote field locations. By expanding access and fostering collaboration with state, federal, and Tribal partners, including the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes, the project will build capacity, create pathways to GIST careers, and contribute to regional economic growth and environmental stewardship.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to increase the number and preparedness of GIST professionals by developing a Modern GIST curriculum that emphasizes programming, data management, spatial analysis, and dashboards. This innovative curriculum will integrate regionally relevant instructional materials and professional experiences, supported by recruitment and retention pathways. Recruitment efforts will focus on establishing a strong participant pipeline from secondary schools while collaborating with teachers and college faculty to raise awareness of GIST careers. Retention will be enhanced through flexible program formats, with instructional materials tailored to regional ecosystems. Paid internships and research opportunities integrating environmental science, resource management, and sustainable recreation will equip students with practical skills for regional employment. Success will be measured through program evaluations, employer feedback on workforce readiness, participant surveys, and graduation rates. Funded by the National Science Foundation's Advanced Technological Education Program, this project supports the education of technicians in advanced technology fields critical to the nation\u2019s economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
