 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research project investigates the impacts of cross-border trade and exchange on diplomatic relations and on land and wildlife management. Investigators specifically examine the role that management of vertebrate wildlife has on cross-border trade and border management.  Research findings have translational impact on border security and workforce development in diplomacy and land administration.  \r\n\r\nResearch findings will contribute to the understanding of diplomatic and trade relations. In addition to training a graduate student, research findings will be disseminated to inform the development of land management and/or cross-border trade and diplomatic strength. Expansion of our understanding of the role that land and wildlife administration play in the governance of trade and diplomacy will contribute to NSF\u2019s priorities of fueling economic prosperity, national security, and global competitiveness. It will also contribute to the science of national security, and secure borders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
