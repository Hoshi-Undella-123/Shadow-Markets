 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides funding for students from U.S. institutions of higher learning to attend the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SmartComp 2025). Smart computing is a multidisciplinary field focused on the design, development, and deployment of computing technologies that are context-aware, adaptive, and deeply integrated with human and environmental systems. Applications span a wide range of domains, including smart health, smart cities, smart energy, and smart transportation. Advancing innovation in these areas requires a highly trained and diverse workforce, critical to maintaining the United States\u2019 long-term technological leadership and economic strength. SmartComp is a premier venue for cutting-edge research at the intersection of computing, sensing, and human-centered system design, aimed at improving the quality of life. Increased participation of U.S.-based undergraduate and graduate students at SmartComp 2025 will help cultivate a next-generation workforce equipped to address complex, real-world challenges through smart technologies.\r\n\r\nSmartComp 2025 will be held in Cork, Ireland, in June 2025. The conference features a robust technical program, including keynote talks, workshops, poster sessions, demonstrations, and extensive networking opportunities with leading researchers, providing an exceptional experiential learning opportunity for participants. This project will provide travel support for U.S.-based students who would otherwise be unable to attend, broadening participation and expanding educational and professional development opportunities for emerging scholars in smart computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
