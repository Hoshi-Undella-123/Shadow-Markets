 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a positioning system that provides reliable vehicle localization without relying on satellite-based or network-based positioning. The system addresses the challenge of guiding vehicles safely in regions where conventional positioning signals are weak, unavailable, or vulnerable to cyber-attacks. All current methods of vehicle localization depend on satellite signals prone to signal disruption and 3D mapping that is costly to produce and maintain, limiting their coverage to select areas. This new method ensures positioning using vehicle's on-board sensors and two-dimensional, widely available maps while a global positioning system (GPS) signal is not available or intentionally blocked by a cyberattack. This resilient approach enhances public safety, supports mobility across urban and rural areas, and bolsters economic productivity by enabling broader adoption of advanced transportation technologies.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This technology is based on the development of a sensor-driven localization framework that integrates vehicle kinematic dead reckoning with widely accessible, two-dimensional map information. The framework employs a kinematic dead reckoning methodology to estimate vehicle position from on-board vehicle sensors such as velocity, steering rate, steering angle, and yaw rate. To address the inherent drift associated with dead reckoning, an arc-length-based map-matching algorithm synchronizes the predicted trajectory with spatial features derived from map data. By merging temporal kinematic predictions with spatial map details, the system maintains high accuracy in environments where satellite-based positioning is unreliable or compromised. This technical innovation significantly advances positioning by offering a robust and reliable solution under challenging conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
