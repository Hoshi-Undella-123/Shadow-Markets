 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of a home aquaponic system used to grow high-value fish species and organic plants in a compact, sustainable design. Aquaponics combines growing fish and growing plants without soil in a closed loop system. The technology developed for this system uses crushed, demolished concrete in the filtration medium, to improve the environment for beneficial bacteria that convert fish waste into nutrients for plants. Beneficial bacteria are key in converting fish waste (ammonia) into materials that plants can absorb. Repurposing concrete rubble turns waste into a productive component of a closed-loop system. In addition, this technology is designed to use less water than traditional soil gardening and may offer a sustainable and organic approach, eliminating the need for synthetic fertilizers while reducing waste. Currently, there is a rising demand for at-home food production systems that promote food independence. This technology may allow users in urban areas to grow organic produce and fish at home.  \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of an integrated aquaponic system that leverages recycled, demolished concrete as a functional component of its biological filtration system. The concrete acts as a pH stabilizer, enhancing the performance of nitrifying bacteria that convert ammonia into plant-friendly nutrients. This technology offers dual environmental benefits, purifying water within the system while diverting construction debris from landfills or waterways. In addition, the system is designed to include multilevel hydroponic plant cultivation, energy-efficient fish feeding mechanisms, and low-maintenance design for consistent performance. Compared with current aquaponics systems, this approach offers a higher-efficiency, modular setup tailored for residential and small-scale commercial use. Users may benefit from increased food self-reliance, improved water quality, reduced system maintenance, and a more sustainable food source, while the environment may benefit from decreased construction waste.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
