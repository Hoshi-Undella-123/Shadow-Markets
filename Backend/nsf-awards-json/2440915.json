 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant focuses on supporting research that intends to advance sustainable textile manufacturing through innovative investigations of hemp fibers. Hemp is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional textile fibers, offering an eco-friendly option to reduce dependence on cotton and synthetic materials for textiles. However, processing hemp into high-quality textiles presents challenges due to their stiffness, lack of crimp, and limitations in existing spinning technologies. This research project aims to overcome these barriers by introducing a modified spinning process that leverages wetting to improve fiber cohesion and adjustments to the spinning triangle for enhanced yarn structure. These advancements contribute to the broader goals of sustainable textile production by minimizing environmental impacts and reducing reliance on synthetic fibers. The overarching goal is to advance the knowledge base in sustainable textile manufacturing and integrate this knowledge with STEM education programs, spanning middle school to doctoral levels, through curriculum development, outreach events, and hands-on research experiences. This project serves the national interest by contributing to the progress of science, advancing environmental sustainability, and preparing a technically skilled workforce.\r\n\r\nThe technical objectives of this project involve developing a comprehensive framework to understand the relationships between the structural, mechanical, and environmental properties of hemp yarns and textiles. Specific aims include: (1) investigating the interplay between hemp fiber surface topography, water capillary adhesion, and fiber cohesion to enhance yarn quality; (2) implementing automated methods for analysis of the spinning triangle using transparent rollers and deep learning algorithms; (3) exploring fiber dynamics in hemp yarns through AI-assisted micro-CT segmentation for detailed structural insights; and (4) performing a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment to evaluate the environmental impact of hemp yarns and textiles. These efforts address fundamental questions in fiber science, such as how surface characteristics and processing conditions affect fiber cohesion and yarn performance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
