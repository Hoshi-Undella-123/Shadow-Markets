 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics of Vanderbilt University will host the Constructive Functions 2025 conference on May 19-22, 2025, to be held in conjunction with the 37th Shanks Lecture, featuring the distinguished mathematician Professor Doron Lubinsky as the Shanks Lecturer. The meeting will bring together leading experts and early-career researchers for in-depth discussions on all aspects of constructive function theory and its applications. This subject has a long and rich history, and its current vitality is attested to by the large number of well-established journals, and recently founded research centers paying attention to the subject. In addition to providing a forum for the exchange of ideas, the meeting will also help identify trends and areas for future research. This award will provide funds to support travel and lodging for participating students, early career researchers, and mathematicians without other sources of federal funding.  More information can be found at the conference website https://my.vanderbilt.edu/constructivefunctions2025/.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theme of the conference broadly covers orthogonal polynomials, potential theory, discrete and continuous energy problems, special functions, approximation theory, random matrix theory, numerical analysis, and various problems related to optimization and efficiency. The fields mentioned above are particularly significant as they have relevance to a variety of mathematical sub-disciplines in addition to several scientific areas. The main aim of the current conference is to foster interactions between researchers from a wide range of subareas represented at our meeting leading to synergistic collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
