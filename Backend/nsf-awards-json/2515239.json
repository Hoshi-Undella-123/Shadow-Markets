 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the instructional, research, and development capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal by strengthening the cyberinfrastructure and cybersecurity necessary to facilitate development of the institution in STEM fields and for the protection of sensitive data. \r\n\r\nThe project is building a cybersecurity infrastructure and culture that supports academic and research activities at the College of the Menominee Nation (CMN), particularly concerning the certificate and degree programs in several fields of STEM, and the development of a cybersecurity certificate. Gaining cybersecurity training and experience with advanced technology, which can be incorporated into the STEM curriculum, significantly equips and empowers CMN faculty, staff, and students to secure their Tribal resources and enterprises.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
