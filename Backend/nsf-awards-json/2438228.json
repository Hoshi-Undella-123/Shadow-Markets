 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project helps young students learn about robots and artificial intelligence (AI) ethics through a fun and creative afterschool program. While new technologies make our lives easier and more comfortable, they also bring up new problems. e.g., \"How can people protect their privacy when using AI?\", or \"What happens if people depend too much on robots and AI?\" Schools have begun teaching about robots, AI, and coding, but it is often done by sitting in a classroom and listening. Ethical topics may not always be discussed in such a setting. This project tries to let students learn robot and AI ethics by acting, moving their bodies, and using arts like music, drawing, and dance. This will help them better understand what is right or wrong when working with robots and AI in their everyday lives. The team hopes students can learn how robots and AI work and start thinking about how these tools affect people and the world around them. To make this happen, the team of researchers will first talk with students and teachers to find out what works and what is challenging. Second, they will design a hands-on curriculum and build tools for learning. Finally, they will run and test programs in schools and museums. The project will result in lesson plans, learning tools, data from the research, and useful tips for teachers and researchers. This research will also support anyone interested in teaching children about robot and AI ethics using creative methods.\r\n\r\nAs demand for robots and AI literacy is rapidly increasing, schools introduce more education programs about robots and AI. However, formal education settings for this topic are still unfamiliar and intimidating. In this project, the research team will design and implement an embodied, informal STEAM (STEM + arts) education program. There will be a focus on robots and AI ethics for young learners (4th-5th graders) so that they can experience how to live with these technologies. This interactive learning program will consist of diverse modules (e.g., acting, dance, music and sound, and drawing). There are three primary research thrusts to the project. First, the team will conduct literature reviews, focus groups with stakeholders. They will identify experiences and challenges for learning AI and robotic ethics using surveys and interviews. Second, the project team will develop a creative afterschool program using participatory design workshops. The research team will also  create technologies and tools to support the AI and robotic learning objectives. The final thrust will implement and evaluate the creative afterschool program in schools and museums. The proposed creative afterschool program will draw upon interdisciplinary expertise and experiences in psychology, computer science, engineering education, interactive arts, and human-robot interaction. This research contributes to the creation of a modularized curriculum, accessible interfaces, and tools for children. The outcomes will produce data and knowledge about children\u2019s understanding and perception of robots and AI ethics. This project will produce guidelines for future iterations of this type of creative afterschool program.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
