 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists are increasingly incorporating machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into their applications to accelerate and enhance scientific research and discovery across a wide range of disciplines. For example, machine learning has been successfully integrated into tools for weather forecasting, earth sciences, astronomy, high-resolution imaging, genomics, and molecular biology. However, the ever-growing size of scientific datasets results in prohibitive hardware resource costs, significantly complicating the deployment of these applications on high-performance computing platforms at scale. Lossy compression \u2014 a data reduction technique that significantly reduces dataset size by removing redundant or less important information \u2014 has proven effective for many scientific datasets, including those from cosmology and structural biology. Despite its promise, integrating lossy compression into AI-driven scientific applications remains a non-trivial challenge, requiring broad expertise in data compression and machine learning, as well as a deep understanding of application requirements, system considerations, and their interactions. These complexities hinder the adoption of this powerful data reduction technique in scientific applications.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to address this gap by providing a cyberinfrastructure that seamlessly and adaptively integrates lossy compression into deep learning pipelines within scientific applications. This integration will reduce memory usage and communication overhead, enabling AI-for-Science applications to scale to massive datasets. The design includes several key innovations. First, it features a user-friendly interface that allows users to define accuracy requirements \u2014 which may evolve during application execution \u2014 and to instantiate different compressors, supporting both customization and extensibility. Second, it provides a software layer that integrates with popular deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, enabling compression to be applied to existing neural network models with minimal code modifications. Third, it incorporates an adaptive execution engine that dynamically selects the appropriate compressors and error bounds based on the desired accuracy, data characteristics (e.g., smoothness, value range, sparsity), model structure, and system configuration. The cyberinfrastructure will support both existing and emerging machine learning accelerators and will be released as open-source software, accompanied by documentation and training materials to promote adoption within the scientific and computing communities. Ultimately, this project has the potential to benefit the broader community by enabling scalable, AI-driven scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
