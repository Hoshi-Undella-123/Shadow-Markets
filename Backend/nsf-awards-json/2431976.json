 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project develops of a remote monitoring system to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with infections among patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). PD removes excess fluid and toxins while correcting electrolyte imbalances in people with kidney failure. This project will develop a medical device with the potential to increase PD treatment access for affected patients in rural areas. This technology will enable high-frequency measurement of cellular biomarkers, providing a novel platform for advancing scientific understanding of infection evolution, immune response, and infection treatment efficacy. Ultimately, the development and commercialization of this technology may make at-home PD accessible to patients living with end stage renal disease, significantly improving their quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe project will enable the real-time microscopic analysis of large volumes of unmodified dialysate flowing through a catheter, reducing the time to infection diagnosis. Completion of the research objectives will result in a system capable of real-time, continuous, and quantitative monitoring of numerous biomarkers relevant to PD-associated infections. To develop this technology, the team will: (1) use simulation models to optimize the optical and flow chamber design parameters for high-resolution and high-throughput characterization of flowing dialysate; (2) construct a benchtop prototype system and characterize the performance using fresh dialysate titrated with relevant biomarkers; and (3) prepare a prototype, analysis algorithm, and protocol for testing discarded dialysate samples. A commercial medical device based on the technology would enable high-frequency at-home screening for dialysate infections, substantially reducing the time to detection and diagnostic confirmation of infection.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
