 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on investigating the commercial potential of an advanced wastewater treatment system that integrates ion exchange materials with biological processes to effectively remove pollutants from wastewater. Traditional wastewater treatment methods often face challenges, such as high energy consumption and insufficient removal of contaminants, which can adversely affect environmental quality and public health. The hybrid approach developed in this project addresses these issues by enhancing treatment efficiency and significantly reducing energy requirements. Water pollution remains a pressing national issue, with billions of gallons of wastewater generated daily, affecting ecosystems, drinking water sources, and public health across communities nationwide. By providing a more efficient and cost-effective method to manage wastewater, this project helps protect the environment and conserve resources. Economic benefits include reduced operational costs for municipal treatment plants, promoting economic growth, and enhancing community welfare through improved water quality.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of an innovative wastewater treatment process combining ion exchange technology with biological nitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation. Unlike conventional methods, this hybrid system operates efficiently at lower temperatures and low nitrogen loadings and under varying pollutant loads, significantly reducing energy usage and operating costs. Critical scientific advancements include ion exchange resins capable of nitrogen removal and enhanced microbial processes enabling nitrogen removal at low nitrogen loadings in mainstream wastewater. Potential adopters benefit from improved treatment performance, reduced chemical and energy costs, decreased environmental impacts, and enhanced system stability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
