 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of undergraduate students enrolled at HBCUs so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The Establishing an Evidence-Based Forensic Education Model at Coppin State University project will serve the national interest by promoting science through forensic education. This project will promote public trust in the justice system by educating and training next-generation forensic professionals to conduct ethical and professional investigations and eventually lead to transparent and accountable legal outcomes. By improving education and establishing career pathways in forensic and related fields for students at the Principal Investigators\u2019 university, the project strengthens the foundation of the local and neighboring justice agencies. Graduates will be prepared to address public safety challenges, including crime, crime-related mental health threats, and other emergency responses. As positive consequences, the project will advance national health, prosperity, and welfare through a solid forensic education model. This project will support national defense by preparing forensic professionals who can contribute to investigating international transactional crimes, counter terrorism, drug trafficking, human trafficking and more.\r\n\r\nThis project will improve forensic science education. Key elements of this project include joint faculty workshops on forensic applications, the creation of interdisciplinary electives, and forensic activities to reinforce applied learning. The project will expand students\u2019 career preparation through educating and training students in legal studies, forensic instrumentation, and internships with local crime laboratories. Students in forensic studies will have the opportunity to collaborate on capstone projects to bridge scientific and legal perspectives. Intellectual merit lies in the integration of STEM, forensic science and legal education, contributing to curriculum innovation and pedagogical research, which is a high demand in higher education today. By engaging students in experiential learning, the project broadens opportunities for students with different backgrounds to pursue forensic education with prospective strengths to fulfill job market needs in forensic science and criminal justice.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
