 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support for the Summer School on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Healthcare, Biology, and Medicine, which will be held from May 27-June 2, 2025, in Rhodes, Greece. The program aims to explore impacts of AI on healthcare, focusing on both the exciting opportunities and the practical challenges that have emerged over the past decade. The summer school will introduce undergraduate and graduate students in engineering, computer science, and biology to the emerging field of artificial intelligence in healthcare, medicine, and biology. The program will bring together students and faculty to discuss AI innovations in these fields and explore how AI can be applied to develop cutting-edge healthcare solutions. Additionally, the summer school will highlight the need for a shift in engineering and science education to keep pace with technological advancements and their impact on healthcare and economic growth. This unique opportunity will allow participants to engage with AI-focused healthcare research and contribute to shaping the future of biomedical engineering education and practice.  \r\n\r\nArtificial intelligence (AI) technologies have transformed healthcare by analyzing diverse health data, including patient records, multi-omics data, clinical data, and behavioral factors, and by automating many tasks that previously required human intervention. Recent advancements in computer hardware, software, and the digitization of health-related data are accelerating AI adoption in medicine. However, while this progress presents vast opportunities, it also brings challenges, raising critical questions about AI's future impact on healthcare and related disciplines. The summer school will address both the advances and challenges of AI in healthcare.  Major areas of focus will include: (1) AI in biotechnology, (2) AI in cardiology, brain discovery, and oncology, (3) AI in tissue engineering, and (4) AI, digital twins, and the metaverse in healthcare. Each of these areas will be discussed in depth, with an emphasis on challenges, practical implications, and real-world applications. The summer school will also examine future directions and innovation opportunities as AI continues to shape the future of healthcare and biomedical research. The summer school will stimulate interdisciplinary research and collaborations among engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists, and medical researchers, and help identify new directions for artificial intelligence, engineering innovations, and technologies in medicine, biology, and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
