 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UCAR Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Science (CPAESS) partners with NSF NCAR\u2019s High Altitude Observatory (HAO) supporting the Earth System Science community by engaging in scientific community building, including conferences, workshops, and events. The PI organizes an annual CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) Workshop, which provides the community an opportunity to exchange and foster new ideas relevant to geospace research.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the suggested work, CPAESS will continue to coordinate and facilitate the Annual CEDAR Workshop in collaboration with the CEDAR Science Steering Committee (CSSC). The CSSC is responsible for the scientific program of the CEDAR workshop. UCAR\u2019s CPAESS provides project leadership for the workshop. While the content of the workshop is designed by and for the scientists involved, UCAR\u2019s CPAESS program contributes administrative, planning, and logistical support, efficient on-line registration mechanisms, creation and publication of agendas and schedules, on-site support while the workshop is in session, and travel management for students and guest speakers. The education benefits of this annual workshop are considerable and are a source of pride. Networking is fostered by poster sessions; at least 85% of the students present posters, while other events include breakout workshops, themed breakfasts, and focused student lunches. Further educational training is available each year through videos, Digital Video Discs, or online videos of the tutorials. The workshop promotes undergraduate and graduate exposure and participation in research by supporting a select number of students to attend the workshop each year. Overall, the CEDAR website, email list server, and the CEDAR slack channel are a communication platform for the community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
