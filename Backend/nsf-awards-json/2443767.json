 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is jointly funded by the CBET Electrochemical Systems Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). The goal of the project is to develop a new rechargeable battery based on an Aluminium (Al)-CO2 electrochemical cell.  The project will address several challenges generally associated with metal-CO2 batteries, including the reversible formation and decomposition of solid discharge products.  It will focus on the use of additives in the electrolyte to mitigate these challenges.  The new battery will serve two important purposes by storing electrical energy and simultaneously capturing gaseous CO2 and converting it into solid minerals.  The project will support an educational program about metal-CO2 batteries for students at all academic levels.  The project will expand educational outreach at the University of New Mexico by providing hands-on energy and sustainability demonstrations for rural elementary K-12 schools.  The goal is to stimulate interest in STEM and help develop a future science and engineering workforce.\r\n \r\nLeveraging a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach that includes material science, electrochemistry, engineering, and systems integration, this project is designed to address critical scientific challenges in the development of metal-gas battery technology. The research focuses on understanding the reversible formation and decomposition of solid discharge products within Al-CO2 batteries. Objectives include deciphering the intricate electrochemical redox reactions occurring within these batteries, delineating the pathways of CO2 reduction and evolution during discharge and charge cycles, and understanding the complex interfacial properties between the gas, electrode, and electrolyte that influence the battery\u2019s overall stability and rechargeability. Employing a combination of electrochemical techniques, theoretical analyses, and microscopic and spectroscopic characterizations, the project will provide insights into the impacts of redox mediators and the dynamic gas-liquid-solid triple interphases on the battery\u2019s functionality. This comprehensive analysis is expected to lead to the development of high-performance, cost-effective metal-CO2 batteries that will enhance grid storage applications and provide a viable solution for carbon capture.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
