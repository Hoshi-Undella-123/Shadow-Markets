 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Smart and Connected Health (SCH) award supports research into new wearable robotic systems to enhance people\u2019s quality of life. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are injuries or pains affecting the human musculoskeletal system. MSDs are one of the largest occupational problems in the United States, which significantly impact people\u2019s quality of life and ability to work. Among them, upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders (UEMSDs) are one of the most common work-related health issues due to the physical performance of work. This research looks to develop new garment-like wearable robots for UEMSD prevention and rehabilitation. The research products will benefit the broader society by providing effective and accessible wearable robots for personalized therapies as well as training the US STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to understand the biomechanics pathology of UEMSDs and develop a new class of wearable robots considering biological characteristics and biomechanics for UEMSD prevention and rehabilitation. This project articulates biomechanics modeling, engineering design, deep learning, and ergonomics toward a wearable robot aided occupational assistance and rehabilitation protocol via four research thrusts. Firstly, this project seeks to understand the biomechanics pathology of UEMSDs and develop computational musculoskeletal models with a focus on occupational tasks. Secondly, the project looks to develop new garment-like wearable robots, i.e., wearable intelligent soft exosuits, considering the biological characteristics and biomechanics pathology of UEMSDs. Wearable sensors look to also be integrated into the wearable exosuits to provide real-time monitoring and estimation. Thirdly, the project seeks to establish wearable exosuits enabled UEMSD prevention and rehabilitation protocol and provide short- and long-term estimations of regained functional outcomes of users. Lastly, the project looks to also study the usability of the proposed wearable exosuits to improve the user-centered design. This project will generate new knowledge in understanding the biomechanics pathology of UEMSDs and new wearable robot enabled therapies for this significant health issue.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
