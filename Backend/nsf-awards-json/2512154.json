 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports US-based participants in the conference \"Perfectly Matched Perspectives on Statistical Mechanics, Combinatorics and Geometry\" to be held June 16-20, 2025, at the Centre International de Rencontres Mathematiques (CIRM) in Marseille, France. The dimer model, a key system in two-dimensional statistical mechanics, has long served as a powerful tool to understand physical phenomena such as magnetism and crystal formation. In recent years, researchers have uncovered surprising connections between the dimer model and other fields, including geometry, combinatorics, and computer science. This conference will bring together leading experts and early-career researchers to share new discoveries and foster collaborations at the frontiers of this dynamic and interdisciplinary area.\r\n\r\nThe dimer model is an exactly solvable model in 2D statistical mechanics, whose correlation functions can be expressed via determinantal point processes, making it a prototypical example of lattice-free fermions. Its conformally invariant scaling limits are often governed by the Gaussian free field. Beyond its role in statistical physics, the model is now known to possess rich algebraic and geometric structures, and it lies at the intersection of combinatorics, integrable systems, and discrete differential geometry. The conference will showcase cutting-edge results in these areas, bringing together experts and junior participants alike to promote cross-pollination between diverse yet interconnected mathematical disciplines. The conference website is at https://dimers.science/events/rick61/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
