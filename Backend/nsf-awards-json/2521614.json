 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Summer Geometry Initiative (SGI) is an intensive summer program aimed at helping student researchers in the field of geometry processing. Geometry processing addresses algorithms, software, and theory relevant to computing over geometric data. These fields brings together mathematics, computer science, and engineering expertise needed to work with 3D models in a range of applications. The summer program provides opportunities for SGI Fellows to engage deeply with current research and work with experienced mentors, allowing them to engage with the research community and to build new collaborations across institutions and researcher levels (from undergrads to faculty and industry researchers).  The SGI is co-located with the Symposium on Geometry Processing conference, a leading venue for this kind of work, further providing opportunities for SGI attendees to learn about and connect to the research community. \r\n\r\nThis grant will support stipends, travel, and registration for about four (4) students who otherwise have limited funding and so might not be able to participate in the summer institute or the conference. Criteria for selection include financial need and growing the size and breadth of the geometry processing community, with a particular focus on providing opportunities for students who would not otherwise be likely to get involved in the field. Prior sessions of the summer program have had demonstrated impact on alumni's graduate work and careers, while elements of the summer program will also be made more widely available through a talk series and tutorials with accompanying materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
