 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports student travel for attending undergraduate and graduate students to the 65th (International) Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWCAS), sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), to be hosted in Lansing, Michigan, USA on Aug. 10-13, 2025. The MWCAS is a premier international conference in the field of circuits and systems. Other than tutorials, keynote, and plenary lectures by leading experts in the field, the conference will be attended by academic and industry researchers and students to present their recent work both in lecture sessions and poster sessions. The conference will host a student paper competition to encourage the best students to keep abreast of the most modern technologies. Recipients of this travel grant will be selected from the pool of students presenting papers and will be paid part of their expenses for travel and registration at the conference. US citizens and permanent residents will be given the highest priority in the selection process. The experience gained by the students in the process is going to be an invaluable component of their education. Due to a good number of industrial participants in the meeting, the experience will also help the students to secure positions in industry, thus contributing to the much-needed technological workforce of the United States. Education and Work Force Development for microelectronics is a major focus of MWCAS 2025. \r\n\r\nThe conference will extensively cover technical areas in Circuits and Systems, including, but not limited to: Analog and Mixed Signal Circuits and Systems, Digital Integrated Circuits and Systems, Power and Energy Circuits and Systems, Sensory Circuits and Systems, Signal, Image, and Multimedia Processing, Communications Circuits and Systems, Radio Frequency (RF) and Wireless Circuits and Systems, Biomedical Circuits and Systems, Neural Networks and Neuromorphic Engineering, Beyond CMOS Circuits and Architectures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
