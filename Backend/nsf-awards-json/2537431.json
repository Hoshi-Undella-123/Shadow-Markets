 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed to provide partial support for student participation in the 57th North American Power Symposium (NAPS 2025), to be held in Hartford, Connecticut, October 26\u201328, 2025. NAPS is a student-focused conference that brings together undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and professionals from academia, industry, and national laboratories to share emerging research in power and energy systems. The symposium provides an important platform for students to present technical papers, receive constructive feedback, and engage with experts in the general field of energy and power systems. To remove financial barriers to participation, the project will fund travel-related expenses including lodging and discounted registration, along with access to technical tours and young professional networking sessions.  The intellectual merit of this project lies primarily in its support for a national platform where students are introduced to advanced research topics and contribute to technical dissemination within the domain of power and energy systems.  The broader impacts of this project include broadening access to meaningful educational opportunities, facilitating inter-disciplinary and inter-institutional collaborations, supporting the progress of science and contributing to the nation\u2019s social and economic wellbeing by preparing participants to address complex infrastructure challenges and promoting innovation in energy technologies.\r\nNAPS 2025 will present a broad set of research and education topics, including coordination between transmission and distribution systems, artificial intelligence applications for grid operations, modeling of distributed energy resources, energy system cybersecurity, power electronics, transportation electrification, and optimization techniques for modern power systems. All accepted papers will be subject to peer review and will be published in the IEEE Xplore digital library to ensure both quality and visibility of student-authored work. In addition to technical sessions, the symposium will provide competitive student paper awards and guided mentoring activities. By enabling student attendance through financial support and creating direct engagement opportunities with leading researchers and practitioners, this project reinforces academic achievements across multiple disciplines and institutions. Through these coordinated efforts, NAPS 2025 will strengthen national expertise in power engineering and contribute to the advancement of scientific understanding in the power and energy field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
