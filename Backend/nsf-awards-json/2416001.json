 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of TCUP institutions. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions increases students\u2019 opportunities to pursue challenging and rewarding careers in STEM fields, supports research studies in areas that may be locally significant, and promotes faculty members\u2019 intellectual and professional growth. This project, under the direction of a Kapiolani Community College faculty member, directly addresses these goals through a study of a recovering urban White Tern population. The project will partner undergraduate student researchers in the field with the PI and local scientists in using techniques such as nest monitoring and tracking to gather important information about the tern\u2019s life history in this setting, while developing students\u2019 knowledge and skills in research. Building on an existing nest monitoring program at the Kapiolani Community College campus, the project will advance understanding of the mechanisms the species is using to repopulate this urban setting, raise public awareness of the importance of urban species, and develop and disseminate K-12 educational materials to inspire precollege learners. Additional outcomes include the enhancement of the research capacity of both the PI and the institution, and strengthening the college\u2019s relationship with the local community.\r\n\r\nThis study aims to advance knowledge on White Tern (Gygis alba) breeding biology in the urban core of Honolulu and address knowledge gaps in the species's nesting and movement that will help illuminate how this seabird persists and thrives in this setting. The research objectives are to (1) assess the biological implications of urban survival for the White Tern; (2) document the spatial and temporal distribution, habitat use, and movement patterns of adults and juveniles in this setting; and (3) contribute to the management of the White Tern and other urban wildlife in Hawaii and beyond. To assess the nesting and movement of the White Tern in urban Honolulu, the study will use radio telemetry tracking, behavioral observations, nest monitoring, and video cameras. Findings will be disseminated broadly to local communities and to professional scientific audiences through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations generated by the PI and undergraduate student researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
