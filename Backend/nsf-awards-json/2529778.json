 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enables researchers to share research ideas and discuss interesting research problems. In particular, this project will focus on supporting US researchers to share research ideas and discuss interesting research problems in a US\u2013Singapore Joint Workshop on Cybersecurity. It  facilitates and fosters collaborations between cybersecurity researchers from both countries. The project seeks support to cover the costs and the travel expenses for invited participants from U.S. institutions to attend the joint research workshop in 2025. The workshop will offer a unique experience for cyber security researchers to engage with each other under a two-day extensive program allowing the sharing of research ideas and the discussion of emerging topics. The project\u2019s broader significance and importance are rooted in its potential to catalyze lasting international partnerships, enhance cross-cultural research competencies, and seed collaborative innovations in cybersecurity. \r\n\r\nThe workshop focuses on emerging research challenges in cybersecurity, trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI), AI for security, resilient networks, and possibly others. Through a combination of keynotes, lightning talks, expert panels, and roundtable discussions, the event cultivates dialogue, identifies shared research interests, and supports the development of joint research collaborations among the researchers. This workshop is expected to result in new research collaborations, influence future research directions, and contribute to the global effort to securing emerging cybersecurity technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
