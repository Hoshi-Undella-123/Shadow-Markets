 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by increasing the numbers of students who are both interested in and well-prepared for careers in geoscience, a field projected to face a significant workforce shortage by 2026. This initiative strengthens STEM education at two-year colleges, a critical access point for addressing the shrinking geoscience workforce. Hands-on research experiences have proven highly effective in motivating students to pursue further education and careers in STEM. This three-year ocean science summer research effort engages student from an urban two-year college in conducting authentic research tied to urgent local challenges. Participants gain direct experience collecting samples and other data on board an oceanographic research vessel and receive competitive stipends to support their involvement. Importantly, these research experiences are designed to build confidence, support persistence in STEM pathways, and expand students' understanding of geoscience career opportunities. By cultivating the next generation of ocean and geoscience professionals, the project contributes meaningfully to meeting the nation's growing demand for a skilled and well-prepared scientific workforce.\r\n\r\nThe project goals are to: (1) increase student awareness and interest in STEM fields, (2) support the development of technical research and networking skills, (3) expand student awareness of natural resources and geoscience career options, (4) increase degree completion and transfer rates to four-year programs, and (5) facilitate professional networking among students, faculty, and ocean scientists in the region. To achieve these goals, a partnership with the Southern California Marine Institute (SCMI) engages students in oceanographic research projects focused on assessing the health of the marine ecosystem within the inner and outer Los Angeles Harbor. Each year of the three-year project involves cohorts of 16 students, five faculty, four SCMI oceanographers, and a marine biologist. Participants spend one day per week on the research vessel and three days in the lab or classroom. Students formulate hypotheses, collect samples, make measurements, process data, and present findings to peers and instructors. Both on and off the boat, students gain first-hand experience in applying the scientific method to real-world problems, develop technical skills relevant to STEM careers, and expand their understanding of natural resources and career options in geoscience and oceanography. Assessment and evaluation efforts focus on measuring the impact of research experiences on student confidence, skill development, knowledge of ocean science, and interest in STEM. Dissemination includes student and faculty presentations and publications in relevant journals. By embedding authentic research opportunities in a local context, this initiative positions two-year colleges as key contributors to advancing innovation in STEM education and cultivating the next generation of geoscientists. The NSF IUSE: Innovation in Two-Year College STEM Education (ITYC) Program seeks to accelerate and advance knowledge about the impact of emerging and evidence-based practices in undergraduate STEM education at two-year colleges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
