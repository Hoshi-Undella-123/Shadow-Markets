 "awd_abstract_narration": "The unprecedented global spread of early humans was facilitated by cognitive, cultural, and physiological adaptations. Among the latter, nasal morphology played a significant role in our species' adjustment to environments with varying humidity levels and temperatures. While traditional bio-anthropological assessments have broadly described nasal shape in relation to heat, this doctoral dissertation study examines nasal morphology\u2019s impact on metabolism and thermoregulation by collecting information using visualization methods and measuring brain temperature. The study can inform clinical research on thermoregulation and advances technological and academic training for undergraduate and graduate students.  \r\n\r\nTo address a classic bio-anthropological question using new biotechnological methods, this project implements a sampling strategy that emphasizes the continuous variation of nasal morphology. The study implements innovative methods and technologies that include: (1) using microwave radiology to develop a detailed quantification and reconstruction of both skeletal and soft-tissue nasal anatomy, (2) recreating environmental variables in a controlled chamber, and (3) measuring metabolic and respiratory responses with a wearable COSMED K5 metabolic unit. Measuring brain temperature is a significant improvement over earlier studies because, among other factors, it influences blood flow and other physiological responses involved in maintaining a stable core body temperature.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
