 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2025 MVAPICH User Group (MUG) Conference is scheduled to take place in Columbus, OH, from August 18-20, 2025, gathering experts, including users, system administrators, researchers, engineers, and students, to focus on sharing knowledge about the MVAPICH libraries. To support student participation, this project will provide funding to enable students to engage with the MVAPICH research and user community. The conference organizers aim to recruit students from all backgrounds. Attending the conference offers students benefits such as 1) exposure to cutting-edge high-performance computing (HPC) technologies, 2) in-depth understanding of designing open-source software environments for HPC systems, 3) training on optimization techniques, and 4) opportunities for interaction with industry professionals and national laboratory experts. This participation significantly impacts the future careers of researchers in HPC, Artificial Intelligence (AI), networking, and message passing technologies.\r\n\r\nMVAPICH is an open-source Message Passing Interface (MPI) library; MVAPICH and its derivatives have played a significant role in exploiting the potential of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)-capable networks, resulting in the rapid growth and adoption of InfiniBand in the High Performance Computing (HPC) community. The MVAPICH library is used by many applications and is installed in HPC Systems worldwide including in the HPC systems at supercomputing centers funded by NSF. The annual MVAPICH User Group conference (MUG) provides a collaborative platform for users, researchers, administrators, and students to exchange knowledge, share experiences, and discuss optimization strategies, troubleshooting guidelines, and other relevant topics. The MVAPICH project and MUG conference help advance the fields of HPC and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and support education and benefits to society at large.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
