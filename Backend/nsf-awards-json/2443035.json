 "awd_abstract_narration": "Legacy spectrum sharing systems, like Spectrum Access System (SAS) used in the Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band, work effectively for static or slowly changing, i.e., slow-moving, federal systems. On the other hand, for other mid-band frequencies such as the lower 3 GHz band, these SAS-like systems face issues such as high operational latency, reliance on expensive sensors, and lack awareness of factors such as weather and traffic types. This project introduces a novel Open Dynamic Spectrum Management (O-DSM) system, built on data-driven, standard-compliant Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, to enable a faster, more efficient, and context-aware spectrum sharing between 5G/6G networks and Federal/non-Federal users.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research aims to develop an O-DSM system to improve spectrum sharing between commercial networks and Federal/non-Federal users across mid-band frequencies like the lower 3 GHz (3.1 \u2013 3.45 GHz) and FR3 bands (7 \u2013 24 GHz). Key goals include (1) developing artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for rapid, precise detection of incumbent radars even in lower signal-to-interference-plus-noise  regime, (2) developing intelligent, context-aware, closed-loop dynamic spectrum control algorithms using digital twin and O-RAN capabilities, (3) creating an AI-assisted framework for testing real-time performance, conformance and security, and (4) prototyping the O-DSM system for evaluation to ensure effective 5G/6G coexistence in mid-band frequencies.\r\n\r\nThis research has the potential to catalyze whole-of-nation broadband network deployments, seamlessly with Federal/Non-Federal systems across mid-band frequencies. It is expected to promote economic growth and solidify U.S. leadership in wireless technology. The project will offer valuable insights to regulatory bodies like the FCC (Federal Communications Commission), addressing key spectrum coexistence issues in mid-band frequencies. The program also includes a strong education component, cultivating future technology leaders through lectures, projects, hands-on training, and mentorship. High school students will also engage in engineering experiences via summer camps.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
