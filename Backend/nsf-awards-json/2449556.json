 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on the commercialization of a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) platform. Leveraging an innovative system architecture, the new platform provides silent, high-quality magnetic resonance brain imaging while operating at just one-tenth the cost and footprint of traditional MRI systems. This dramatic reduction in size and cost will make advanced imaging technology accessible to communities across the United States, particularly in rural areas where traditional MRI installations are not feasible. The platform achieves clinical equivalency to modern scanners while requiring minimal infrastructure, representing a breakthrough solution for widespread medical imaging access. The broad deployment of this affordable and effective MRI technology will accelerate the diagnosis of strokes, dementia, and head trauma, potentially saving thousands of lives and improving patient outcomes in communities throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project centers around B1 encoding, a novel methodology in designing MRI systems. Unlike traditional MRI architecture that relies on large, expensive, and loud electromagnets known as B0 gradient coils, this approach enables their partial or complete elimination. By removing these components, the system saves hundreds of pounds in weight and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cost, while enabling greater portability. At its core, B1 encoding represents a fundamental reimagining of MRI system design that promises to maintain clinical value while drastically reducing system complexity and cost.  The neuro-imaging MRI system powered by this technology will be the first commercial system to demonstrate high-quality imaging without the use of B0 gradient coils.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
