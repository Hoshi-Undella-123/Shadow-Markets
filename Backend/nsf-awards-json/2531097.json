 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project examines on the commercial potential of a novel regenerative medicine platform designed to address peripheral neuropathy, a debilitating condition affecting millions of individuals in the United States and world-wide. The project centers on two core innovations: lab-grown human nerve cells and a new therapeutic compound. The human nerve cells serve as a critical research tool for scientists and pharmaceutical developers to study nerve function and test potential treatments. The therapeutic compound under development is designed to protect and repair damaged nerves, offering hope for peripheral neuropathy patients who have few disease-modifying treatment options. By enabling more precise research and offering a new clinical pathway, this project supports public health, scientific progress, and future economic benefits through potential drug development and reduced healthcare burden.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of human pluripotent stem cell-derived peripheral neurons, including sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic subtypes, and a first-in-class small molecule designed to protect peripheral neurons, prevent neuronal degeneration and promote axon regeneration. The neurons offer biological fidelity for preclinical research, enabling disease modeling and high-throughput drug screening with human-relevant cells. The novel compound, validated in preclinical models, demonstrates neuroprotective and pro-regenerative effects that are not currently achievable with existing therapies. Together, these innovations form an integrated research and therapeutic platform that can accelerate both fundamental understanding and clinical intervention for peripheral neuropathy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
