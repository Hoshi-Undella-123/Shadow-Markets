 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of a cancer treatment for locally advanced cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. This treatment is aimed at cancers involving tumors spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes, but not to distant organs. Currently, over 40,000 cases of liver and pancreatic cancers that cannot be removed by surgery are diagnosed in the U.S., often with poor prognoses and high recurrence rates. This technology provides a targeted, minimally invasive solution that can be integrated into current clinical practice to improve outcomes. The technology is based on removing diseased tissue with light activation, which may enhance survival while reducing treatment-related toxicity. As a result, patients may experience fewer complications and hospitalizations. This technology may help advance cancer care, lower healthcare costs, and expand access to more effective, less toxic therapies for patients with locally advanced disease.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a light-triggered ablation technology for cancer photodynamic therapy. While photodynamic therapy is effective at killing primary tumor cells, addressing tumor spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes remains a challenge, as most cancer deaths result from metastasis. This technology combines two non-heat-based chemical ablative methods that have been proven safe with low adverse effects for unresectable tumors: photodynamic therapy, which involves delivering light-activated, tumor-killing photosensitizers, and percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), which involves the direct injection of pure ethanol into tumor nodules. This therapy is designed for localized tumors that cannot be surgically removed, such as unresectable liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, and soft tissue sarcoma. This approach ensures the treatment remains confined to the tumor site, thereby significantly minimizing side effects, compared to standard chemotherapy. Light activation enables localized tumor destruction and may also stimulate immune-mediated tumor killing. When integrated with computerized tomography (CT) imaging, this platform allows real-time monitoring of drug delivery and dosing adjustments, supporting personalized therapy. This technology may advance cancer care and overcome the limitations of current cancer treatments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
