 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Level 2 Engaged Student Learning project aims to serve the national interest by enhancing the academic outcomes of undergraduate students studying biology and its major themes using an innovative, engaging interactive video tool. This tool is important because it was developed in collaboration with expert educators from across the United States, and it aims to introduce and reinforce evolutionary concepts. Major themes in biology, such as evolution, while complex, are foundational in nature; it describes changes in life on Earth over time that can be observed in real-time and across geologic time scales. By leveraging students' existing interest in video game use, this project provides an opportunity to increase the understanding and acceptance of evolutionary theory\u2014a core biology subject of both significant challenge and importance by interacting with an innovative video tool.  \r\n\r\nThis project aims to leverage the prevalent gaming habits of over 80% of U.S. adolescents to enhance evolution education. The scope of this research includes the development and evaluation of a biologically accurate video game as a novel educational tool to enhance evolution education and acceptance in undergraduate biology. This tool is intended to be used as a method for interactive evolution education at the undergraduate level, allowing for the evaluation of game-based learning in increased understanding and acceptance of evolution. Thus, the goals for this study are to: (1) Systematically develop an evolution-based video game, (2) Evaluate the relationship between the number of student interactions with the video tool and students' level of understanding and perception of evolution, and (3) Determine the effect of player agency in game-play on student performance and perception. Rich instructor interviews, student interviews, and a national survey analysis are intended to guide improvements to the game, assess effectiveness, and evaluate acceptance of evolution. As evolution is a necessary puzzle piece in the building of a scientifically literate population, the level of understanding about evolution by the general public and STEM graduates is of great concern. This research intends to pave the way towards improving the understanding in undergraduate education, and address how to more effectively teach such topics in the classroom. Outcomes may contribute to national efforts to improve STEM education by advancing innovative teaching practices, developing and adapting instructional methods, and broadly disseminating effective educational tools. All products are expected to be freely disseminated to participating science faculty and the broader education community, equipping educators to effectively introduce evolutionary concepts. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
