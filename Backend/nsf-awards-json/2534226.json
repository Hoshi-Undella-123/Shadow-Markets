 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Operators on analytic function spaces\" will take place at the Centre International de Rencontres Mathematiques (CIRM) in Marseille, France from December 2 - 6, 2024.  The goal is to create a diverse group of mathematicians poised to solve an important set of problems in function and operator theory, and to allow attendees to develop new directions and partnerships. Funding will be used for US participant support, with priority going to members of underrepresented groups and early career researchers. CIRM provides facilities and equipment as well as an excellent library and serves as a place for collaborative work.\r\n \r\nThe focus of the conference is on recent progress on Hilbert and Banach spaces of holomorphic functions and the operators acting on them. During the week at CIRM participants will discuss important open questions in function theory and operator theory, including operators on model spaces, Toeplitz and Hankel operators, cyclic vectors, sampling, frames, interpolation and reproducing kernels, and the Crouzeix conjecture. In addition to the talks, the conference will offer activities for attendees to interact and discuss future directions for research. More information may be found at the conference webpage, https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/3085.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
