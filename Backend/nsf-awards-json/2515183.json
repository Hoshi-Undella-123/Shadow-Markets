 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by building capacity and expanding undergraduate research experiences (URE) using existing infrastructure at a large, urban two-year college in the Southwest. Participation in undergraduate research has been associated with a range of short- and long-term benefits, including enhanced analytical thinking, increased academic achievement, stronger student persistence, and greater interest in postgraduate STEM education. Importantly, two-year colleges are well-positioned to prepare students for transfer to bachelor's degree programs and for direct entry into the workforce, and UREs can foster critical, industry relevant competencies. This project seeks to develop a transferable model of UREs that integrates consistent reporting procedures, standardized data collection, and evidence-based practices through faculty development designed to promote scientific inquiry. Critically, this work contributes to national efforts to support STEM education improvement and strengthen pathways to STEM careers.  \r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to: 1) integrate existing pockets of undergraduate research into centralized, comprehensive program; 2) develop a methodology to monitor student performance and progress across STEM majors; 3) incorporate evidence-based pedagogies that apply across content areas and curricula; and 4) support faculty development in implementing undergraduate research experiences (UREs) within a two-year college setting. These goals are addressed through a structured effort to build institutional capacity, including the creation of a dedicated URE coordinator position, formalizing the program within the Center for Learning, establishing a cross disciplinary committee, engaging student voices, and implementing a systematic assessment plan to examine impacts on both students and faculty. Faculty professional development serves as a cornerstone of the initiative, offering ongoing workshops and leadership opportunities to advance pedagogical innovation. Assessment and evaluation efforts focus on the impact of UREs on academic outcomes, student perceptions and attitudes toward STEM, and the extent to which institutional capacity for undergraduate research strengthens over time. Critically, the project contributes to the broader STEM education field by generating knowledge about UREs at two-year colleges and examining how evidence-based strategies impact student success. At the local level, the initiative aims to offer a scalable model for implementing undergraduate research programs across other colleges within the local two-year college system. Dissemination efforts include student and faculty presentations and publication and relevant academic and practitioner journals. By embedding research experiences in the fabric of two-year college education, the project positions these institutions as vital engines of STEM workforce development. NSF IUSE: Innovation in Two-Year College STEM Education (ITYC) Program seeks to accelerate and advance knowledge about the impact of emerging and evidence-based practices in undergraduate STEM education at two-year colleges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
