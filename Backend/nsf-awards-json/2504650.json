 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal ecosystems are vital to our planet, supporting diverse marine life and protecting shorelines. However, these ecosystems face increasing threats from human activities like coastal development and fish farming (aquaculture), which can pollute the environment. This international research partnership, called the HERITOR Project, studies the impact of aquaculture waste on seashore biodiversity in Cape Verde, a group of islands off the coast of West Africa. Understanding these impacts is crucial for developing effective conservation strategies and protecting these valuable natural resources for the future. This IRES project provides a unique opportunity for undergraduate students to participate in international research, and to develop science communication skills through their outreach work in Cape Verde and the U.S. This project fosters development of the next generation of scientists equipped with the skills to monitor marine biodiversity and solve important environmental problems. Research conducted through this project contributes to global efforts in preserving marine ecosystems and biodiversity documentation.\r\n\r\nThe HERITOR project establishes a baseline of seashore biodiversity in Cape Verde and monitors changes over three years, before and after the release of waste from a shrimp aquaculture plant. Research teams examine various components of the ecosystem, including fish, macroinvertebrates, and algae, at the aquaculture site and a nearby control site. The project uses various research methods, including underwater cameras, acoustic monitoring, and ecological surveys. Through this project, 18 undergraduate students from Bridgewater State University are trained by U.S. and Cape Verdean experts in marine ecology, conservation science and statistical analyses. For 8 weeks each summer, students conduct research that builds knowledge and capacity for ecological monitoring in Cape Verde. Their research experience is enhanced by immersion in the social and cultural landscape of Cape Verde, a critical element for preparing U.S. students to effectively collaborate in international scientific endeavors. The summer research program is flanked by pre- and post-travel training in ecological theory, conceptual frameworks in biodiversity conservation, standard research methods and skills, and data analysis. Students also develop leadership and communication skills as they discuss their findings with both scientific and public audiences. The combination of development of strong research skills alongside leadership capabilities is crucial for preparing well-rounded STEM professionals who will drive global innovation and engagement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
