 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project investigates the commercial potential of a modular, low-cost, flow reactor system that enables chemical reactions to be performed more safely, efficiently, and affordably. The system, which features components that can be manufactured using three-dimensional printing, addresses a critical market need for affordable and customizable chemical synthesis tools, particularly for small to mid-sized companies. Traditional flow reactors are often prohibitively expensive and designed for large-scale operations, leaving early-stage pharmaceutical and specialty chemical companies without viable, affordable options. This innovation aims to reduce financial and technical barriers to continuous flow chemistry, a process known for improving safety and reproducibility in laboratory settings. By making sophisticated chemical processing equipment more accessible, the project supports national interests in economic competitiveness, scientific advancement, and public health through safer laboratory practices and more efficient chemical manufacturing of chemical building blocks and materials for the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and organic electronics industries. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a customizable photochemical flow reactor built using three-dimensional printing techniques, allowing for rapid prototyping and cost-effective production. The reactor system enables fast adaptive changes of various parameters such as reaction volume, flow rate, temperature control, and wavelength tuning for light-driven reactions. The technology also integrates in-line monitoring and purification modules, including ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy as well as chromatographic components. Unlike conventional glass or metal reactors, the modular and printable design enables on-demand fabrication of replacement parts, streamlining maintenance and customization. The technology simplifies traditionally complex processes, enabling users with minimal training to conduct advanced reactions, thereby lowering the expertise threshold required for modern chemical continuous flow synthesis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
