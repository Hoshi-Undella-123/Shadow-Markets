 "awd_abstract_narration": "The two Maurice Auslander Distinguished Lectures and International Conferences will be held in April 2025 and April 2026 at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. There are two main objectives of the conferences: The first is to share knowledge about recent developments in the chosen topics, two topics each year. The second is to create new connections between the topics. The topics are cluster theory and Hochschild cohomology in 2025 and triangulated categories and topological data analysis in 2026. The conferences will include leading researchers in the topics under consideration as well as interested researchers at different career stages, including graduate students and post-doctoral scholars.\r\n \r\nIn more detail, cluster algebras were introduced at the turn of the century by Fomin and Zelevinsky, and they immediately became a very broad and influential topic in many areas of mathematics. One of the central problems is to construct categorifications of cluster algebras. This will be one theme of the 2025 conference. Hochschild cohomology is the other theme of the 2025 conference. Experts in the field will give talks on the latest developments, with a focus on the categorification of cluster algebras given by quivers with potentials, where the potentials are Hochschild cycles. More information is available on the conference website: https://sites.google.com/view/madlconference/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
