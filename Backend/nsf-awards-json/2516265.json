 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to improve understanding of the removal of atmospheric hydrogen due to microbe-mediated soil uptake. The central question addressed by the project is whether microbial adaptation to elevated hydrogen is sufficient to mitigate leaks from the hydrogen energy sector. Soil uptake is currently the largest source of uncertainty in the budget, lifetime, and distribution of hydrogen. The project evaluates microbial adaptation to two key forces: moisture regulation of soil hydrogen uptake and micrometeorological regulation of hydrogen plume-surface interactions. The research consists of field measurements in two natural systems differing in moisture and temperature regimes, computational modeling analyses, and measurements using a state-of-the-art mobile laboratory in the vicinity of real hydrogen energy installation sites and from controlled-release experiments. Advancing understanding of the hydrogen soil sink addresses societally important issues of air quality, radiative balance, and UV levels. The project includes research, education, and mentoring opportunities for young scientists and students. \r\n\r\nThe proposal team will leverage their expertise in soil microbial hydrogen uptake, modeling, and novel in situ ecological and mobile lab measurements to generate data and improve models with the following specific project activities planned: (1) generate continuous in situ measurements of hydrogen fluxes under ambient and elevated hydrogen conditions at two sites with contrasting moisture regimes, (2) build a 1-D diffusion-consumption model and improve the hydrogen deposition scheme in a global community model, (3) characterize hydrogen releases from real and simulated hydrogen energy infrastructure using a mobile lab, and (4) quantify the proportion of hydrogen plumes intercepted by soil. Overall, this project will set expectations for the atmospheric and ecological impacts of growth in the hydrogen energy sector while also generating knowledge and tools to project changes to the atmospheric hydrogen budget.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
