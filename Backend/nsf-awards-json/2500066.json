 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) EPSCoR Graduate Fellowship Program (EGFP) supports EGFP designated institutions and programs in EPSCoR jurisdictions by providing funding for graduate fellowships for new or continuing EGFP-eligible applicants. EPSCoR jurisdictions support a total of three years of stipend and associated cost-of-education (COE) allowance for each NSF EPSCoR Graduate Fellow. This award at the University of New Mexico proposes to support 10 EPSCoR Graduate Fellows whose research will align with the unique goals and programs supported by the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), Directorate for Geosciences (GEO), Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), and Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE).\r\n\r\nIn this project, Fellows will participate in graduate studies in several fields, including biology, earth and planetary science, geography and environmental studies, civil and environmental engineering, electric and computer engineering, chemical and biological engineering, economics, physics and astronomy. Robust mechanisms are in place to support student success, ensuring personalized mentoring and encouraging professional development. In addition to the research experience, Fellows will have opportunities to participate various science symposia and seminars.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
