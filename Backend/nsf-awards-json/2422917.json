 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, to enable automated deposition of scientific data for three-dimensional structures of large biological molecules (e.g., protein, DNA, RNA) to two important open-access data resources. This information explains how cells in our bodies work at the atomic level and what happens when mutations change cellular function in cancer and other common diseases. It will be made freely available to many millions of basic and applied researchers, working across the sciences in both academia and biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, contributing to human health. It will also be made freely available to educators and their students, supporting K-12 and college teaching of the biological sciences, graduate and professional training, and workforce development. The information will also be used to elevate the scientific literacy of the public through outreach activities related to fundamental biology, biomedicine, energy sciences, and biotechnology.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of the project are twofold. First, computer software will be developed to streamline time-consuming tasks that are now carried out manually to contribute scientific information to the Protein Data Bank and the Electron Microscopy Data Bank. These two open-access data resources have a decades-long history of making scientific data generated with financial support from United States federal government agencies freely available to users via the internet. Second, information management by the Protein Data Bank and the Electron Microscopy Data Bank will be improved with new data science and software tools to package information from related structural investigations together, thereby providing a more complete three-dimensional understanding of how the natural world works and how changes in gene sequence lead to changes in function and cause diseases in humans, animals, and plants or promote higher yields of economically important food crops.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
