 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of flexible and wearable electronics using adjustable materials that integrate both thermal regulation and electronic functionality into a single, lightweight platform. Currently, many next-generation devices, such as smart medical wearables, fitness trackers, and environmental sensors, face challenges related to overheating, inefficiency, and limited durability. These devices rely on passive cooling or bulky components that cannot meet the demands of compact and body-integrated applications. This technology addresses these problems by creating a new class of two-dimensional (2D) materials with engineered Moir\u00e9 patterns, patterns created by mechanical interference of light caused by overlapping patterns of lines. These materials enable customizable heat flow while preserving excellent electrical performance and may be used to build flexible field-effect transistors (FETs) that dynamically control temperature and power in real time. Embedding heat management technology directly into the device material reduces the number of components, increases energy efficiency, and enhances long-term reliability. This solution may create safer and more effective health monitoring devices and longer-lasting consumer electronics, while lowering energy costs for users across medical, industrial, and home environments.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of Moir\u00e9-patterned two-dimensional (2D) field-effect transistors (FETs) with tunable thermal and electronic properties. This technology leverages recent scientific advances in bilayer and multilayer 2D materials, where precise interlayer twist angles create Moir\u00e9 superlattices with highly controllable heat and charge transport. Unlike conventional materials that treat heat management and signal control as separate problems, these 2D structures offer integrated solutions by tuning both properties simultaneously. The core technical approach involves nanoscale fabrication and high-precision dual-laser Raman thermometry to characterize and optimize performance. Users may benefit from improved device performance, smaller form factors, and lower failure rates \u2014 critical factors for adoption in wearable electronics, smart textiles, and portable Internet of Things (IoT) systems. By embedding heat management directly into the device material, this technology may reduce component count, increase energy efficiency, and enhance long-term reliability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
