 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Educational Instrumentation project at New Jersey City University will strengthen undergraduate learning in computer science, mathematics, and chemistry. Specifically, this project will secure computing equipment to outfit a new computer lab, which will allow students to engage in AI, data science, and computational chemistry learning experiences, including course-based research opportunities. An estimated 650 students will utilize the project-funded equipment each year across 13 courses, 7 majors, and 2 minors. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to enrich the learning and experiences of undergraduate students by providing critical computing resources for students in computer science, mathematics, and chemistry. Providing students with opportunities to build computational and research skills will better prepare them to find gainful employment and contribute to the STEM workforce. The project will assess the impact of the project funded equipment using student feedback, enrollment in impacted courses, and the development of new curricula and course-based undergraduate research experienced that utilize the new computing resources. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and increase capacity to engage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM teaching and learning at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
