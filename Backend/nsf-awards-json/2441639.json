 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enhance our understanding particles that can swim and change shape, much like tiny microorganisms. These particles, called active particles, take energy from their surroundings to create small fluid flows that propel them forward. This project will explore the behavior of active particles that can also change their shape.  The project will use electric fields to influence the movement of shape-changing particles and to understand how the particles interact with each other.  The project will then examine the collective behavior of swarming active particles. Results of the project can be used to determine and control the properties of a fluid containing active particles, which potentially can be applied in biomedicine, environmental remediation, and micro-scale manufacturing.  The project will also support training of future scientific leaders from high school to graduate and postdoctoral levels.\r\n   \r\nThis award will advance the understanding and application of active particulate systems by exploring the dynamics of shape-morphing particles capable of autonomous propulsion. Leveraging electric fields as a precise control mechanism, the research will investigate how these fields manipulate shape-morphing particles to achieve diverse locomotion patterns while simultaneously promoting interparticle interactions and emergent collective behaviors. By synthesizing particles from a range of materials with different properties, the project aims to leverage both electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flows and induced charge electrophoresis (ICEP) to achieve targeted responses to programmed shape changes. The project will also focus on elucidating the mechanisms governing pairwise interactions among shape-morphing particles under varying electric field strengths. The ability to tune particle interactions and motions through external stimuli may open new avenues in advanced manufacturing, bioengineering, and environmental applications. Furthermore, the initiative includes a commitment to enhance STEM education by engaging high school students through outreach efforts, thereby fostering the development of future leaders in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
