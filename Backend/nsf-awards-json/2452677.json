 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor William Evans of the University of California, Irvine, is studying the development of the unique properties of the rare-earth elements, i.e. scandium, yttrium, and the lanthanides, while training students in the chemistry of these strategically important metals. The rare-earth metals have special properties that make them critical components in powerful magnets, efficient lighting, communications & computing technologies, catalysis, and electronic and medical applications. The project is designed to expand our understanding of the properties of complexes of these special heavy metals so we can better utilize these elements in chemical and technological applications.\r\n \r\nThe project is focused on the synthesis of new molecular complexes of scandium, yttrium, and the 14 lanthanide metals (such as cerium, neodymium, gadolinium, lutetium) in the +2 oxidation state. These lanthanide complexes have unprecedented electronic states that have the potential to achieve small molecule (CO, CO2, N2) activation in unusual ways and to provide a basis to invent new types of quantum bits (qubits) which are critical to advances in quantum information science. New methods of synthesis using X-radiation and copper-metallocene reagents will be explored to generate new classes of compounds. The reactivity of new structural types of reduced dinitrogen complexes will be studied to learn about nitrogen activation. The first bis(cyclopentadienyl) metallocenes of scandium will be examined to define factors important in qubit development. The research will involve training the next generation of scientists to lead the world in the chemical development of these critical national resources. The PI will also leverage his role as Director of the Eddleman Quantum Institute to promote and to attract students to broad area of quantum science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
