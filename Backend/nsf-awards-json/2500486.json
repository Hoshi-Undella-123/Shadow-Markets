 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) EPSCoR Graduate Fellowship Program (EGFP) supports EGFP-designated institutions and programs in EPSCoR jurisdictions by providing funding for graduate fellowships for new or continuing EGFP-eligible applicants. EGFP awards support a total of three years of stipend and associated cost-of-education (COE) allowance for each NSF EPSCoR Graduate Fellow.\r\n\r\nThis award at the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa provides support for 10 EPSCoR Graduate Fellows whose research will align with the unique goals and programs supported by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG) and Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS). The central theme of the project revolves around engineering and materials science addressing both experimental as well as computational research. Through this fellowship program, student participants will have multiple opportunities for research and educational interactions that will strengthen each Fellow's scientific impact. Apart from an intensive research experience, Fellows will have the opportunity to network and interact with partners from industry and national laboratories.\r\n\r\nIn this project, Fellows will participate in graduate studies in engineering and science fields related to plastics degradation, laser chemical vapor deposition processes, high voltage electrochemical synthesis, nanoparticle catalysis, machine learning and computational design of ceramic materials, bioprinting, biosensing, and porous storage materials.  Fellows will be recruited nationally and mentored by a team of well-qualified and dedicated faculty affiliated with the Alabama Materials Institute (AMI) at the University of Alabama.  This project has the potential to increase the number of skilled scientists and engineers in areas of relevance to energy, defense, transportation, and human health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
