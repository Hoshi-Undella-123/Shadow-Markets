 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of a medical device designed to diagnose and treat muscle-wasting disorders. Muscle-wasting disorders affect millions of individuals globally, leading to decreased quality of life, loss of mobility, and increased healthcare costs. These disorders can result from aging, chronic diseases, traumatic injuries, or prolonged inactivity. Current solutions primarily focus on symptom management rather than addressing the underlying loss of muscle function and structure. This technology is based on electrical stimulation combined with diagnostic capabilities to effectively restore muscle health and functionality. Directly addressing muscle degeneration and promoting muscle regeneration may improve patient outcomes and quality of life. In addition, this device may reduce healthcare costs by providing an effective alternative to existing treatments, while enhancing patient independence.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of an advanced bioelectronic platform employing integrated therapeutic stimulation and diagnostic monitoring technologies. The core technology is based on a customizable, wearable bioelectronic interface capable of delivering targeted neuromuscular electrical stimulation to promote muscle regeneration and strength recovery. Unlike existing therapies, this technology uniquely incorporates real-time diagnostic sensors to continuously monitor muscle health, allowing tailored, patient-specific therapeutic interventions. The technology uses platinum nanoparticles and conductive polymer coatings to enhance electrode performance, biocompatibility, and signal fidelity, providing advantages over conventional electrode systems. The device may be used to quantitatively detect and reverse muscle atrophy, offering a cost-effective solution to patients and a biometrics companion to clinicians. Clinicians and patients benefit from improved therapeutic efficacy, personalized treatments, and reduced recovery times.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
