 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Northwestern University, located in Evanston, IL, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2025-2027. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done using an online instrument. Students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths. Additional standard and tailored assessments will be used to refine activities continuously to meet program goals. Training from this program will prepare students for research careers in the rapidly growing field of synthetic biology, enhancing economic competitiveness and helping to grow the US leadership role in this cutting-edge field.\r\n\r\nThe program will provide mentored research experiences in the rapidly growing field of synthetic biology, in which new biological systems are constructed to enable biological solutions to important problems. A strong cohort of faculty from departments including Molecular Biosciences, Chemical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Pharmacology, Chemistry, Engineering Science and Applied Mathematics, Cell and Developmental Biology, and Civil and Environmental Engineering will serve as mentors in the program. Students will carry out independent laboratory and/or computational synthetic biology projects such as the development of new biosensors for contaminants in water, self-healing materials, new gene therapy delivery mechanisms, new designed enzymes, and more. Concurrently, students will participate in a carefully designed curriculum to expose them to a variety of laboratory techniques as well as the skills necessary for success in their future STEM careers, including ethics, responsible conduct of research, communication and networking. Activities include seminars, workshops, teas with faculty, and field trips to local synthetic biology companies. At the end of the program, students will present their projects and results at a research symposium. Students should apply to the REU using the NSF ETAP site (http://etap.nsf.gov), and more information is available at http://synbreu.northwestern.edu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Rocklin at grocklin@gmail.com), co-PI (Dr. Aristilde at ludmilla.aristilde@northwestern.edu), or the program staff (synbreu@northwestern.edu). This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
