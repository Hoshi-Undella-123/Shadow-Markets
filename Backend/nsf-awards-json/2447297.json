 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Michigan State University, located in East Lansing, MI, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2025 - 2027. Plants are essential for human civilization, providing the foundation for food, fiber, fuel, and medicine. As the global population grows there are increasing strains on natural resources, the environment, and agricultural production. This makes research in plant genomics and training the next generation of plant scientists become even more critical. To address these challenges and drive the future U.S. bioeconomy, the next generation of plant scientists must not only possess a strong foundation in plant biology but also be proficient in computational biology and data science. This integrated approach to training is essential to develop scientists who can transcend disciplinary boundaries, harness big data, and address fundamental questions in plant biology. Ultimately, students will gain the skills and knowledge to leverage plant biology for developing improved crop varieties and contributing to the U.S. bioeconomy, addressing critical national industry priorities. This REU program addresses this need by providing an integrated training experience in plant science and computational biology. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. The program will be assessed using validated methods and the subsequent career paths of REU participants will be tracked. Students should apply to the REU site using NSF ETAP (Education and Training Application: https://etap.nsf.gov).\r\n\r\nREU participants will engage in faculty-mentored research focused on genomics of plants and photosynthetic microbes that will be suitable for students interested in genomics, molecular genetics, biochemistry, chemistry, and computational biology. In addition to conducting research projects and receiving training in computational biology, participants will gain essential foundational skills and mentorship to thrive in the STEM workforce. The program fosters critical thinking through hands-on research experience and provides multiple opportunities for participants to refine their scientific presentation and communication skills. They will receive guidance on graduate school applications and life as a graduate student, while separate weekly seminars and career workshops expose them to diverse research topics in plant sciences and career paths within and beyond academia. Ultimately, the program's goal is to empower participants to reach their full potential in science and cultivate the next generation of scientists who are equipped to address global challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
