 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site aims to advance research in computational sensing for human-centered artificial intelligence (AI), with an emphasis on creating new knowledge to enhance interactions between human and artificial agents, using generative machine learning methods while moving away from traditional prediction. REU projects conducted over three cohorts of participants will promote human-centered AI systems that are robust in noisy conditions where humans excel, but AI typically struggles. From science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education perspective, the REU Site also explores the effectiveness of triad-based REU student research teams. It also leverages a synergistic partnership with RIT's AWARE-AI NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) program, increasing REU participants' near-peer interaction with PhD students trained by experienced faculty in co-mentorship. The Site will offer some of its programmatic elements nationwide.\r\n\r\nThe REU Site in Computational Sensing for Human-centered AI pursues four ambitious goals. First, the project will advance fundamental research in multimodal computational sensing for human-centered AI, leveraging generative machine learning techniques. Second, the investigators will formally assess the efficacy of triad-based REU research projects compared to results from previous pair-based REU projects. Third, the project will evaluate and report on a novel collaborative partnership between the undergraduate cohort-based REU Site and a graduate cohort-based NRT program. Fourth, the REU Site will disseminate findings in conferences or journals, both of the scientific outcomes of REU teams' research and of Site-based computing education research to the STEM community. Students will receive guidance for pursuing graduate careers in computing or STEM and experience public outreach enrichment that promotes the communication of research to wider audiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
