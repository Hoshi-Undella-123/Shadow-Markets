 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of undergraduate students enrolled at HBCUs so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of the CyberQuest-Curriculum Innovation and Experiential Learning for Cybersecurity Workforce Development project is to leverage a collaborative initiative to address the lack of access to current learning tools and establish a new cybersecurity concentration, enriched by immersive and experiential learning opportunities at Fisk University and Meharry Medical College.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, the project aims to:  1) develop a new curriculum in cybersecurity, 2) integrate experiential learning opportunities, and 3) foster interdisciplinary collaboration through AI-assisted Research Buddy. This project will strengthen computer science education at Fisk University by enhancing the quality of education available for students. The proposed activities will strengthen a partnership between Fisk University and Meharry Medical College, provide students with foundational skill sets to solve real-life scenarios with cybersecurity practices, and build technical skills to increase competitiveness for the workforce. The expected outcome of this project will generate new pedagogical knowledge on hands-on training and modern learning strategies that result in students\u2019 building practical skills, confidence, and academic momentum, while supporting pathways to internships, graduate study, and cybersecurity careers. The project has the potential to serve as a scalable model for other institutions seeking to expand access to advanced STEM education through experiential learning in cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
