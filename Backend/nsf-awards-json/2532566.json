 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the instructional, research, and development capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal by strengthening the cyberinfrastructure and cybersecurity necessary to facilitate development of the institution in STEM fields and for the protection of sensitive data.\r\n\r\nThe project is building a cybersecurity infrastructure and culture that supports academic and research activities at Nuesta Hidatsa Sahnish College (NHSC), by re-cabling and upgrading 600 lines of cabling as well as map and test all lines in the main campus building and the associated cultural center.  The upgrade has a direct and positive effect on NHSC's ability to sustain and grow its STEM (and other) instructional programs and research, while protecting valuable information and enabling off-campus access to learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
