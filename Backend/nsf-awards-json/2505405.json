 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled radio frequency identification (RFID) sensing systems through an international research collaboration with the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia. The core research theme of this project is to enhance the accuracy and affordability of RFID-based sensing by integrating AI frameworks into custom-designed sensor systems. Through this international partnership, eight U.S. students per year participate in an immersive eight-week summer research program at UTS. This project is mutually beneficial, strengthening our existing international collaboration by advancing critical applications such as smart packaging and precision agriculture, while simultaneously training U.S. students in this vital area of research. This project strengthens the training of U.S. students in RFID sensing systems by providing first-hand experience in the design, fabrication, and testing of these technologies. In addition, professional development workshops and industrial site visits further enrich the students' experience in this critical research area.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses fundamental challenges in RFID sensing system design, specifically improving sensor accuracy and reducing overall system cost, to enable broader adoption of this technology across various applications through collaborative research between the United States and Australia. This work is expected to enable the development of low-cost and accurate RFID sensing systems by creating an AI framework that accounts for external environmental factors affecting sensor performance. This project provides students with the opportunity to (i) design RFID sensing systems through simulations, (ii) fabricate and characterize them using state-of-the-art equipment at the University of Technology Sydney, and (iii) analyze data and develop AI algorithms to enhance sensing system accuracy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
