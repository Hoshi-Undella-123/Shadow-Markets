 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support a five-day graphite-focused workshop in Sri Lanka in April 2026, including three days of field visits to major graphite mines at Bogala, Kahatagaha, and Ragedara. The event will convene 50\u201375 experts (15 from the U.S.) across academia, industry, and government to address research priorities on natural graphite. This mineral is essential for lithium-ion batteries, fuel cells, and advanced materials. Sri Lanka\u2019s century-old vein graphite offers a unique, high-purity resource and geologic analog for unexplored U.S. deposits. This workshop will launch collaborative U.S.\u2013Sri Lanka research across six themes: (1) geology of vein graphite in high-grade metamorphic terranes; (2) petrogenesis using modern analytical techniques; (3) material characterization of lump and chip graphite; (4) critical mineral assessments; (5) development of graphite for battery anodes; and (6) potential for high-purity Sri Lankan graphite in graphene and advanced technologies. The workshop will be held at the University of Peradeniya in central Sri Lanka, \r\n\r\nThe workshop will mark the first-ever collaboration between the U.S. and Sri Lanka in graphite research, occurring at a pivotal time for critical mineral exploration worldwide. While the U.S. has limited expertise in graphite mineral systems and specialists often work in silos across the supply chain, Sri Lanka has many experts but lacks access to advanced analytical tools like laser ablation split-stream capabilities and rhenium-osmium geochronology. This workshop will facilitate the exchange of geological and metallurgical knowledge and analytical techniques between the two countries. In addition, the workshop will focus on innovative applications of graphite in rechargeable batteries and graphene production. By bringing together experts from both nations, we aim to establish a foundation for long-term scientific collaboration that could lead to significant advancements in the critical minerals sector and ultimately enhance graphite supply resilience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
