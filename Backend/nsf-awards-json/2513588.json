 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Harold Jimenez Polo is awarded a National Science Foundation Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (NSF MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and broader impact activities. This fellowship supports the research project entitled \"Algebraic and Factorization Properties of Monoid Semidomains.\" The project activities will be conducted at the host institution, Clemson University, under the mentorship of Dr. James B. Coykendall.\r\n\r\nThe research will investigate the algebraic and factorization properties of monoid semidomains\u2014algebraic structures that generalize polynomial rings by dropping the assumption of additive inverses. The work will explore foundational questions such as the ascent of atomicity from semidomains to their polynomial extensions and will study analogues of the Goldbach conjecture within this setting. This research has potential applications across algebraic geometry, number theory, and theoretical computer science. As part of the broader impacts, Dr. Jimenez Polo will lead mentoring activities that support students who are enthusiastic and passionate about mathematics. Through research seminars and workshops\u2014such as the Simple Words seminar and the Summer Workshop for Intrepid Mathematicians (SWIM)\u2014and through initiatives like CrowdMath and MIT PRIMES, he will provide these students with meaningful research experiences and help foster a supportive, collaborative community of emerging mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
