 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of \u201cwaterless\u201d single use tablets for personal care products. Most skincare and cleansing products contain more than 85% of water. Currently, products containing water typically are bulkier and heavier, requiring more storage space and cost to transport. These waterless products are lighter and require less storage space and fuel for transportation. The absence of water also removes the need for harmful preservatives, which may reduce product volume and increase the shelf life. The technology is based on \"self-activating\" chemistries that allow each tablet to transform into skincare products such as toner, serum, lotion, and soap by adding a teaspoon or less of water. These tablets are portable and easily used for travel. Each tablet is meant to be used just once, which may be more hygienic than conventional products packaged in bottles and jars. In addition to skincare, waterless products may be used in pharmaceutical and food industries. For example, tablets carrying highly concentrated active ingredients may help combat/prevent wound infections and offer rapid pain management for topical wounds.  Waterless technology may produce products that are easier to use and transport, while conserving water and providing better safety. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of waterless, tableted fprmulations for single use personal care products. Commercially available personal care products containing water are bulky and may lack hygiene, portability, and convenience. This technology has been developed for self-emulsifying or self-activating tablets that disintegrate and dissolve rapidly even when carrying water-insoluble ingredients such as oils. This ability is adapted from the pharmaceutical industry where each tablet quickly disintegrates in water and emulsifies to improve the aqueous solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs. Each skincare tablet is composed of ingredients in specific ranges that permit rapid disintegration followed by self-emulsification while withstanding mechanical stress during manufacturing and storage. Products are designed for single use and quickly transform into traditional soap, liquid and semi-solid personal care products without water or with only a few drops of water. In addition, the personal care products are light in weight, reduce 70% of the space, do not require harmful preservatives, and demonstrate improved shelf life. This technology may be used to improve skincare products such as toner, serum, lotion, cream, and soap as well as carry highly concentrated active ingredients (e.g., antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and pain relief agents) that may help combat wound infections and offer rapid pain management for topical wounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
