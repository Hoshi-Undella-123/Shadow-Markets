 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project facilitates international experiences for U.S. students through collaborative research between Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Aeron\u00e1utica in Brazil. The program provides both undergraduate and graduate students with hands-on fundamental research experience in the field of thermal management for next-generation aircraft. As the aviation industry works to reduce emissions, lower operating costs, reduce noise, and increase design flexibility through electric and hybrid-electric technologies, there is an urgent need for new cooling systems that are both efficient and lightweight. Through this project, each cohort of participating U.S. students spend ten weeks in Brazil collaborating with researchers and gaining exposure to international aerospace industries. The program emphasizes teamwork across cultures and disciplines. Collaboration with Brazilian experts strengthens the scientific outcomes and prepares students for global careers in thermal science engineering. \r\n\r\nPropulsion electrification presents various environmental and technological hurdles. Among these obstacles lies the need for effective thermal management systems that are both lightweight and capable of handling the increased heat generated by all-electric and hybrid-electric aircraft, a demand surpassing that of traditional aircraft designs. Fundamental understanding of the heat transfer performance is crucial because many of these materials and thermal management solutions have not been previously used in the intended area of operation for electric and/or hybrid electric aircraft. This IRES project addresses knowledge gaps and equips students with a deep understanding of fundamental issues and the thermal behavior of various heat transfer media before their implementation into critical thermal management systems. The research activities in this IRES program are centered around two major thrusts. These themes focus on highly promising yet not fully understood heat transfer media and approaches: 1) solid-to-liquid phase change materials for passive thermal management and 2) transcritical CO2 refrigeration systems for active cooling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
