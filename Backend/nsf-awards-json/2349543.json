 "awd_abstract_narration": "The EXPLORE REU Site is a multidisciplinary project that involves collaboration with multiple scientists from various programs and departments at the University of Maryland Baltimore County and partner institutions. The purpose of the EXPLORE REU Site is to benefit and attract a broad group of undergraduate students to the world of science by offering a wide range of scientific and networking activities within the field of Earth and Atmospheric Science. Students will have the opportunity to work on the development of new software and satellites, engage in data processing, utilize global numerical models, and conduct hands-on experiments for the characterization of atmospheric particles. Each student will be guided by a primary mentor and assisted by a supporting team and will work on a specific research project. In addition, a series of activities involving professional development, networking, and personal growth will be offered during the duration of the program. \r\n\r\nThe EXPLORE REU Site will provide opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in high-level research projects encompassing a wide range of topics: atmospheric composition, atmosphere-ocean interactions, aerosol-cloud feedbacks, satellite remote sensing observations, and satellite development and design. Each project addresses critical questions currently under investigation by the scientific community.  The program will directly address issues related to making the geosciences a viable career for all students and strengthening the future geoscience workforce.  The program will leverage students\u2019 preparation across many STEM fields to help strengthen the geosciences workforce.  Specifically, this program will train and empower 30 REU students (10 students each year) with technical knowledge in space and environmental data analysis, quantitative methods, programming skills, instrument operation expertise, and effective science communication skills. The program will enable REU students to contribute to projects addressing critical issues for our society with implications for advancements in the areas of atmospheric composition, air pollution, human health, weather, and climate, as well as pressing environmental challenges, while developing practical skills in instrumentation, software, and data processing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
