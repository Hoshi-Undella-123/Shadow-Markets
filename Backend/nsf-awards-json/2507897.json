 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2025. The fellowship supports the research and training of the fellow, advancing biological science in innovative ways. Life adapts to environmental changes not only through mutations but also through modifications that do not alter DNA sequences, a phenomenon known as epigenetics. In bacteria, these epigenetic changes may play a crucial role in their ability to survive and thrive in different environments, yet this area remains poorly understood. This research aims to uncover how epigenetic modifications influence bacterial adaptation, particularly in response to antimicrobial compounds. Understanding these mechanisms will shed light on how bacteria persist in changing ecosystems, with implications for antimicrobial resistance, environmental health, and public health outcomes. In addition to its scientific contributions, this fellowship will emphasize mentorship and training, providing hands-on research experiences to students and equipping them with valuable skills for careers in science. By bridging fundamental research with real-world applications, this work benefits both scientific progress and society.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses a critical gap in our understanding of the factors and mechanisms involved in bacterial adaptation by focusing on epigenomic responses to ecological shifts. To adapt, bacteria acclimate to those shifts primarily via two component response systems. This project will investigate the role of epigenetic modifications in bacterial adaptation (to silver nitrate), the underlying mechanisms, and possible interactions of epigenetic modifications with two component response systems to improve our understanding of bacterial adaptation. The study system will use mutants and silver-evolved populations. This research will incorporate new sequencing techniques, computational approaches and growth assays to monitor changes in the methylome of Escherichia coli in changing environments. The fellow will be trained in genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic technologies, as well as computer modeling. This project will increase our understanding of bacterial fitness in the ecosystem in response to induced epigenetic changes. The fellow will receive invaluable training in microbial genomics, high throughput sequencing, computational genomics and experiential learning/student-centered pedagogical practices. The fellow will provide mentorship opportunities to K-12 students, undergraduate and graduate students in biological research particularly in epigenetics. The fellow will also develop training materials and publish findings from data outcomes of this research that can be used by the scientific community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
