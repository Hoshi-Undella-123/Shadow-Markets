 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by preparing a skilled, robust engineering workforce capable of advancing U.S. energy independence, infrastructure innovation, and rural energy resilience. The project is built on three foundational learning methods: interdisciplinary design, experiential learning, and professional networks to create dynamic educational experiences that link engineering frameworks to rural energy resilience and infrastructure. Students will participate in week-long engineering intensives focused on community-based research projects in emerging energy technologies and microgrid systems within Alaska's remote and off-grid communities. Led by researchers from the Alaska Center for Energy and Power (ACEP), these intensives intend to build interdisciplinary problem-solving skills, industry-relevant stakeholder collaboration skills, and professional networks. Participants interested in continued mentorship by the instructor-researcher will apply for funding through ACEP's summer internship program, then culminate their work in their senior engineering capstone. By incentivizing a sustained inquiry pathway, the project will increase retention in engineering programs and advance the next generation of energy engineers. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to advance understanding of how immersive, thematic learning experiences impact student retention, engagement, and career aspirations in engineering. The scope includes designing a flexible intensive framework, delivering four week-long, place-based intensives with energy researchers tailored to Alaska's unique energy landscape, and sustaining research relationships for researchers and engineering students. At the time of graduation, participants are expected to have a rich portfolio of practical experience, research achievements, and a deep professional network, making them highly competitive members of the energy workforce or graduate programs. Project outcomes include a tested framework for thematic intensives that address critical energy security challenges, deeper integration of undergraduates into state and federally funded energy research, and a model for energy workforce pipelines. Results are projected inform future strategies for scaling experiential engineering education that drives economic growth and energy innovation across U.S. regions. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
