 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to support a platform for sharing progress, exchanging ideas, and facilitating further collaboration between interdisciplinary researchers, stakeholders, and public, private and government representatives. This grant will design, organize and execute the 2025 Dynamics, Control and Systems Diagnostics (DCSD) PI Meeting at National Science Foundation (NSF) in Alexandria, Virginia on September 4 and 5, 2025. The two-day program will provide a centralized and lasting repository of information illustrating research ideas explored and milestones achieved by DCSD funded projects. The PI Meeting will advance knowledge by: exposing the rich progress of current DCSD funded research; reviewing new developments in DCSD foundations and the efficacy of new, emerging applications; exploring technology transfer and partnerships; discussing future directions of the DCSD program by identifying long-term challenges and opportunities; allowing PIs to showcase their research results; providing a networking environment; and promoting general outreach. \r\n\r\nThe 2025 NSF DCSD PI Meeting will be the first PI Meeting since the establishment of the DCSD program. Hence it will provide an opportunity for this community to have fruitful discussions and collaborations between established and junior DCSD researchers to discuss innovative ideas and ultimately to expand the number of new DCSD PIs. The program will specifically provide support for DCSD PIs from R2 institutions and non-PIs who either have not been successful in pursuing an NSF DCSD award or who have never applied for a DCSD grant but would like to. The meeting will provide a pathway for aspiring PIs to directly interact with current DCSD awardees and program directors to understand what NSF will expect to see in a successful DCSD research. The mini-workshops and discussion panels with NSF program directors will provide opportunities for PIs of interest to consult or discuss their projects, thereby providing an interactive pathway for direct engagement and for quickly seeking advice or feedback on the scope and significance of the future proposals. If successful, this type of session could be a standard program component of future DCSD PI Meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
