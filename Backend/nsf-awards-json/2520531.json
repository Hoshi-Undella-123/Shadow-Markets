 "awd_abstract_narration": "This mixed-methods project will develop an intervention that focuses on the impact of participation of research teams from different science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.  It involves a comprehensive evidence-based training program that allows for dialogue among researchers at different career stages.  The program aims to improve understanding of responsible research practices, provide tools for a holistic perspective on the topic, and positively influence the dynamics and culture of the research environment. Project outcomes may include: a broader recognition of the need for an interdisciplinary, holistic approach to responsible research training; development and implementation of such training in laboratory settings; and a comparison of the efficacy of training approaches across STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to develop, implement, and study an intervention to improve research environments. The intervention includes topics such as research collaboration, mentorship, and navigating off-site scholarly activities. Participating research teams will attend an in-person interactive training intended to provide education and concrete tools to improve laboratory culture. The project team will use metrics to measure relevant changes on variables such as understanding of responsible research and collaboration. The approach will involve comparing pre- and post-intervention reports.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
