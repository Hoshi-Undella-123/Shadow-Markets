 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to build a strong talent pool for Wisconsin's growing bioscience industry that aligns with both current and future economic expansion in the region. By drawing on the expertise and resources of the current biotechnology program, the project aims to raise awareness of bioscience career paths among high school students, as well as students and advisors at Madison College and its regional campuses. Efforts include career mentorship and support for high school dual credit students and two-year college STEM students, along with expanding dual credit course options, delivery methods, and outreach to rural areas with limited access to bioscience career opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to strengthen the biotechnology workforce through a multi-faceted approach. First, the project intends to expand high school students' exposure to and preparation for biotechnology careers by integrating a career-focused dual-credit curriculum, increasing access to these courses, and providing comprehensive support and industry mentorship for high school teachers. Second, the project fosters collaboration among departments to promote biotechnology career opportunities for STEM students. Additionally, the project examines factors influencing STEM student retention and their consideration of biotechnology and other technical career pathways. A key outcome of this initiative is the development of a dual-credit biotechnology curriculum, hands-on lab activities, and career pathway materials, which will serve as lasting resources for high schools and two-year colleges. These materials, along with insights from the project, are set to be shared at the local and national level through conferences, and professional networks. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
