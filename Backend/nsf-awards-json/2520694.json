The 2025 Symposium on Industrial Ecology for Young Professionals (SIEYP), organized by the International Society for Industrial Ecology Student Chapter Board (ISIE\u2010SCB), focuses on translating industrial ecology research into tangible outcomes through policy development and implementation. The main goal of this symposium is to provide an opportunity for young US-based professionals who perform research in Industrial Ecology (IE) to use their research skills to identify and develop ways to translate environmental engineering and sustainability research concepts into action, discuss their novel research ideas and experiences, and receive constructive feedback. The symposium will take place just prior to the ISIE Biennial Conference taking place July 1-4, 2025 in Singapore. The ISIE student community consists of more than one hundred members. ISIE\u2010SCB is suited to achieve the above symposium goal due to its proven track record and robust event planning experience. There are several sub-goals that the SIEYP aims to deliver to participants through its programming, including: (1) learning how to identify and effectively communicate the intersectionality of research with pertinent and emerging policy initiatives; (2) building skills of argument framing to appeal to cross\u2010disciplinary audiences including policy makers; and (3) translating research and communication skills into effective research planning and grant writing habits.\r\n\r\nSIEYP will provide participants with fundamental skills that will assist in research and grant writing, oral presentation, developing effective research products and increasing the impact of their research. The symposium will also provide students and young researchers with the skills to connect their research interests to policy relevant questions. Moreover, this symposium will facilitate long\u2010lasting international relationships and collaboration among young IE professionals. These collaborations provide future opportunities for joint projects that may result in benefits to US science and society at large. The SIEYP will have immediate benefits for those US researchers who attend, and compounding benefits for domestic and international environmental sustainability efforts that stem from idea-sharing and collaborative projects over time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
