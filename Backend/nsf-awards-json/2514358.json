 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on understanding the molecular details of how bacteria maintain the selective permeability of their membranes, which is essential to support life, during growth. Such information can inform the development of novel strategies to help combat bacterial infections. Millions of antibiotic-resistant infections occur each year, requiring the constant development of new drugs to treat these and effectively kill the bacteria causing them. This work will engage the student-scientists of Bryn Mawr College in groundbreaking research at the interface of Biochemistry, Biology, and Molecular Biophysics in both research and academic teaching labs. Outreach partnership work with the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia will extend the impact of this work into the greater community.\r\n\r\n\tThis project aims to understand the role of bacterial membrane proteins in the biogenesis pathway of phospholipids, a required process for the growth and proliferation of Gram-negative bacteria. This work will utilize a complementary array of experimental techniques, including in vitro reconstitution of the lipid trafficking pathway and quantification of lipid flux between synthetic vesicles \u2013 this novel approach creates a platform for the systematic investigation of experimental conditions on lipid trafficking. Additional techniques will include traditional biochemical analyses of membrane proteins, mutagenesis and characterization of protein variants, molecular dynamics simulations, and single particle cryo-Electron Microscopy (EM). Together, these experiments will directly fill a void in our current understanding of the biogenesis of macromolecules required for bacterial survival.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
