 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) EPSCoR Graduate Fellowship Program (EGFP) supports EGFP designated institutions and programs in EPSCoR jurisdictions by providing funding for graduate fellowships for new or continuing EGFP-eligible applicants. NSF EPSCoR Graduate Fellowships provide a total of three years of stipend and associated cost-of-education (COE) allowance for each NSF EPSCoR Graduate Fellow.\r\n\r\nThis award at Iowa State University (ISU) will support ten EPSCoR Graduate Fellows with funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) EPSCoR Graduate Fellowship Program (EGFP). The Fellows' research will be aligned with goals and programs managed by NSF's Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) and the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP). The goal of this project is to train the next generation of biologists who will contribute basic biological research and build the bioeconomy. Fellows will be trained by faculty spanning the breadth of biological sciences at ISU, and in many cases, will be co-mentored on projects that span subdisciplines. Professional development opportunities will prepare Fellows for careers in academia and, through internships with the bioscience industry, for careers that build the bioeconomy. Activities will help develop scientific infrastructure and drive innovation in the state of Iowa and across the nation.\r\n \r\nTen graduate Fellows will be recruited from those who have received honorable mention designations from the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP). These Fellows will be matched with faculty who align with their interests and trained in one of several ISU graduate programs in biology. A faculty team will train Fellows, oversee their progress toward their degrees, and facilitate their transition into the scientific workforce. Professional development for academia will include mentoring in teaching, grant writing, development of intellectual property, and University service. Fellows seeking careers in industry will be matched with internship opportunities in central Iowa, which is home to an extensive network of agriscience research and development. Overall, the award will develop a skilled workforce in Iowa that is prepared for STEM careers that meet needs of the US and contribute to the development of a strong bioeconomy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
