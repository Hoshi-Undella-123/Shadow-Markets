 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artificial intelligence (AI) built upon biological input can emulate downstream biocomputing and send feedback to alter biological activities, offering closed-loop hybrid intelligence (HI) framework to connect biological and physical computing systems. This research project aims to establish closed-loop hybrid intelligence by co-designing high-resolution neuromodulation and neuromorphic devices that can apply to cultured neurons and organoids. The outcome of this research will result in engineering tools and methods that may make an impact in AI hardware, human-machine co-learning, brain-machine interfaces, and disease modeling. The educational objectives of this project are aimed at training and inspiring young engineers and scientists who are equipped with the multidisciplinary background required to help define the future trajectory of AI, brain sciences, and advanced manufacturing. The completion of this project will: 1) advance transformative AI technologies capable of closed-loop cell interfacing with recording, processing, and controlling modalities; 2) educate undergraduate and graduate researchers to contribute to the nation\u2019s workforce needs in AI, advanced computing, and brain-computer interface; 3) contribute to K-12 education through weekend seminars and mentoring student-teacher pairs; and 4) promote public awareness of AI technologies towards biological/bio-inspired computing.\r\n\r\nThe research objective of this project is to combine high-resolution optoelectronic neuromodulation and neuromorphic hardware to demonstrate closed-loop HI in biological neural networks and organoid models. The resulting HI system will showcase the power of optogenetic-neuromorphic co-design capable of closed-loop, energy-efficient, and high-accuracy cell interfacing, and suggest its promise in developing optogenetic interventions in organoid models. Three major contributions of this research project include: 1) optogenetic cell interfaces composed of close-packed light-emitting diodes and microelectrodes, which are  particularly co-designed with neuromorphic cell interfaces towards closed-loop HI; 2) neuromorphic cell interfaces composed of close-packed photomemristors and microelectrodes, which are co-designed with optogenetic cell interfaces towards closed-loop HI; 3) demonstration of the closed-loop HI in cultured neural networks and organoid models, with perspective applications for developing effective optogenetic interventions. \r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Foundations of Emerging Technologies Program and the Electronics, Photonics and Magnetic Devices Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
