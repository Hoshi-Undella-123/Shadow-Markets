 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to support about nine (9) promising U.S.-based graduate students to participate in a two-day Doctoral Research Symposium to be held in conjunction with the ACM 2025 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing (CSCW) in October 2025. CSCW is the premier international forum for research investigating the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. CSCW research spans a wide range of work, civic, and everyday life activities, as well as a wide range of computing technologies and academic disciplines. The CSCW doctoral consortia, which began in 1992, serve to bring together students and mentors across the wide range of topics, devices, institutions, and disciplines the CSCW community encompasses, providing an important place for exchange of ideas in the broader community. These events have long helped young doctoral scholars both refine their research and advance their professional development within the CSCW community under the guidance of experienced mentors in the field.\r\n\r\nGoals of the doctoral consortium include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field mentor them and provide constructive advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend the conference. Students will give brief presentations about their research, followed by discussion and constructive feedback both from members of the faculty panel and other student participants. The feedback will be geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other CSCW research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. Mentors will discuss different aspects of research the research profession, including career paths, funding, work-life balance, and related topics.  Together these activities will help to prepare future leaders in the field and form professional relationships that persist beyond the doctoral consortium itself.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
