 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymer foams are essential in industries like packaging, electronics, and healthcare due to their low cost, lightweight nature, insulating properties, and energy absorption. However, current foaming methods offer limited flexibility for material customization, rarely introduce new functions to meet specific application needs, and often lack environmental sustainability. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant supports fundamental research to establish an innovative manufacturing method for on-demand foaming of polymers and composites. The project aims to advance scientific understanding of selective foaming, which could enable applications such as miniaturized sensors and wearable electronics, benefiting US industries ranging from aerospace to medical devices. The project also looks to lay the groundwork for a sustainable manufacturing approach, promoting the use of recyclable materials in advanced technologies like flexible electronics. By improving material performance and advancing sustainable production methods, the research can contribute to national prosperity and environmental sustainability. Additionally, the project integrates research and education to cultivate a skilled US workforce. Targeted outreach efforts leverage the multidisciplinary nature of this research to inspire students and encourage them to pursue studies and careers in advanced materials and manufacturing, building a more innovative workforce for the future.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER project looks to build understanding of solid-state foaming and microstructure engineering in thermoplastic composites through laser-induced foaming. This direct-foam-writing technique enables selective surface engineering and controlled microstructure modification within polymer composites to create locally tailored structural, thermal, and electrical properties. The mechanisms of cell nucleation and growth and the effects of filler properties will be systematically studied to establish relationships between composite properties, process parameters, and cell microstructures. Mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of the microcellular composites will be experimentally characterized, while physics-based models will be developed to predict the effective properties of the foamed regions. These findings look to elucidate process-structure-performance relationships, resulting in an efficient, scalable, high-resolution fabrication process for devices with spatially tuned properties. This program also integrates research and education to train new workforce members in manufacturing practices that emphasize recyclable materials. A new course will be developed to equip students with expertise in sustainable electronics, multifunctional polymer composites, advanced image processing, and laser-matter interactions. Outreach activities will engage K-12 students in communities across Washington state, sparking early interest in STEM and demonstrating feasible pathways to the University of Washington, empowering them to become future leaders in manufacturing innovation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
