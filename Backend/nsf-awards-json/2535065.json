 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project investigates the commercial potential of contorted polyamide membranes for desalination. This membrane technology addresses the growing problem of water scarcity by making seawater and brackish water desalination more affordable and accessible as an alternative water supply. Contorted membranes are designed to allow water to pass through more quickly than conventional membranes while still effectively removing salt and other impurities. These membranes can be integrated into standard reverse osmosis systems, making them compatible with both new and existing desalination plants. Their higher water permeability reduces the quantity of membranes required for desalination, lowering the capital and operating costs of desalination facilities. By lowering these economic barriers to desalination, contorted membrane technology can help communities and industries secure reliable sources of clean water, advancing public health and economic development across the U.S.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of contorted polyamide membranes, a novel class of high-performance desalination materials engineered to enhance water transport and salt rejection. These membranes are synthesized using shape-persistent Tr\u00f6ger\u2019s base diamine and triptycene diamine monomers, which increase the internal free volume within the polyamide network. This structural innovation yields an eightfold increase in water permeance compared to conventional polyamide membranes fabricated with m-phenylene diamine, while maintaining sodium chloride rejection greater than 99%. The enhanced permeability-selectivity of contorted polyamide membranes approaches the upper bound reported for polyamide membrane materials. These performance improvements can intensify membrane desalination processes by reducing the membrane area required for water production and lowering system-level energy demands. The membranes are designed for integration into standard spiral-wound reverse osmosis modules, ensuring compatibility with both new and existing desalination infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
