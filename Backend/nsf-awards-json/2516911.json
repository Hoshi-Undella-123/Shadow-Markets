 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of self-healing fibers for concrete applications. Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world, forming the backbone of critical infrastructure such as buildings, power plants, bridges, highways, and dams. However, cracking in concrete remains a persistent and costly issue, leading to shortened service life, frequent repairs, and significant disruptions. In the U.S. alone, billions of dollars are spent annually on maintaining and repairing aging concrete infrastructure. These repairs not only incur direct financial costs but also cause indirect losses through downtime, traffic delays, and reduced community resilience. This technology provides a solution by embedding self-healing fibers into concrete, enabling self-repair of cracks in concrete without external intervention. In addition, this innovation has the potential to reduce maintenance needs, extend infrastructure lifespan, and minimize service interruptions. The commercial impact spans construction, transportation, energy, and defense sectors where durable and low-maintenance concrete infrastructure is critical. This technology also may enhance the resilience of communities by ensuring safer, longer-lasting structures and reducing the economic and logistical burdens associated with frequent repair and reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of adding multifunctional, polymer-based, self-healing fibers to concrete. The fibers are made multifunctional using a three-in-one solution design to enhance fracture resistance, enable damage-responsive activation, and deliver autonomous self-healing in concrete. This solution is accomplished by functionalizing polymeric fibers with a micron-thick alginate-based hydrogel layer containing healing agents, including bacterial spores. The hydrogel layer is encapsulated within an outer protective shell that is tunable and strain responsive. The protective shell prevents premature activation during normal concrete service conditions and ensures targeted healing activation only when a crack occurs. The functionalized fiber is designed to enable selective and efficient self-repair and also enhances mechanical performance of concrete systems through fiber reinforcement. Unlike other self-healing systems, such as microcapsule-based technologies that lack structural reinforcement and activate indiscriminately, this technology maintains the load-bearing capabilities of commercial polymer fibers while adding tunable healing functionality. The underlying research includes advanced manufacturing, materials synthesis, coating stability, and mechanical testing in cementitious composites that demonstrate the mechanical performance and controlled healing behavior of the fiber. This technology may extend the lifespan of concrete infrastructure and improve the resilience of built environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
