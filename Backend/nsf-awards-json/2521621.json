 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many species, competition for mates occurs at multiple levels, from seasonal behavioral displays to less apparent changes in physiology. Such competition shapes the reproductive strategies of both males and females in a species, but the genetic mechanisms underlying these strategies are not well understood. This doctoral dissertation project assesses the impact that female reproductive status has on male physiology in a non-human primate species, with particular focus on genomic and transcriptomic factors related to gene expression and resulting changes in cell production. The study advances knowledge about specific reproductive mechanisms with translational potential for fertility studies, supports undergraduate and graduate science training and mentorship, and generates new genomic data resources. The project's methodological approach to the analysis of tRNA advances priorities in biotechnology. \r\n\r\nReproduction competition at the cellular level is a significant, but understudied, aspect of sexual selection in primates. The study combines transcriptomic and evolutionary genomic analyses to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating reproductive seasonality in primates. Novel transcriptomic data are used to elucidate how seasonal reproduction influences the molecular basis of gamete production and competition in a seasonally reproducing primate. The study also investigates the mechanisms by which male reproduction in primates is shielded from threats including inflammatory immune response and oxidative stress.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
