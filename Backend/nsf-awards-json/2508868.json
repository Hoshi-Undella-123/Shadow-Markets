 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation at the Macaulay2 software development workshop that will be held from June 30 to July 4, 2025, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Macaulay2 is a leading computer algebra system for supporting research in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. At the workshop, researchers will extend its functionality by working in small groups to develop high-quality software packages that will be made publicly available. The workshop gives new users the opportunity to learn from experienced programmers; it will feature tutorial sessions on Macaulay2, as well as basic training in version control and software development. The workshop will include professional development activities intended for early-career mathematicians.  \r\n\r\nThe choice of coding projects is motivated by recent research advances in mathematics. Each project will be led by a leading researcher, and the projects involve a wide variety of active research areas within commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, representation theory, and algebraic combinatorics. Specific goals include computations related to Galois and monodromy groups, matrix Shubert varieties, Mackey functors, symmetric linear forms, Koszul duality, and positroid varieties. More information can be found on the workshop\u2019s website:  https://macaulay2.github.io/Workshop-2025-Madison/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
