 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant will support the acquisition of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for interdisciplinary research, education, and outreach activities at Pennsylvania State University Harrisburg. The instrument will significantly enhance research productivity and the educational experience for both faculty and students by providing essential hands-on training and enabling advanced research capabilities on campus. It will foster interdisciplinary, interdepartmental, and interinstitutional collaborations across disciplines such as materials science, mechanical and civil engineering, medicine, chemistry, and biology. Additionally, the SEM will be integrated into the curriculum for undergraduate and graduate courses across multiple academic programs, benefiting over 1,000 students annually, who will have the opportunity to explore materials and structures at the microscopic level. This will be the only scanning electron microscope in the capital region of Pennsylvania. The SEM will also play a key role in STEM summer camps, workshops for K-12 students and teachers, and outreach programs with a major science museum in the Harrisburg region. This instrument will enhance industry collaborations, fostering innovation and economic growth in the region. The initiative aligns with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science, advance national prosperity, and enhance education and diversity in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nA scanning electron microscope uses a focused beam of electrons to create high-resolution images, enabling detailed analysis of microstructures and elemental distribution on sample surfaces. The SEM will facilitate research in areas such as biological materials, solar cells, additive manufacturing, solid-state batteries, earthquake engineering, and cellular physiology. It will support various research activities, including the characterization of materials, analysis of cellular structures, and the development of new engineering solutions. The SEM offers the capability to provide high-resolution images, compositional imaging using backscattered electrons, and elemental analysis and mapping in both high vacuum and reduced vacuum modes. This makes it possible to analyze high-vacuum incompatible specimens, hydrated and biological samples, and non-conductive materials. This equipment will be an essential tool for early-career researchers and students, promote interdisciplinary studies, and enhance research infrastructure at Penn State Harrisburg and surrounding universities and industries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
