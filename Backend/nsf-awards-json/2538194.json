 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conference: Workshop on Atomic Scale Fabrication for Quantum Information\r\n\r\nThis award will support a workshop to explore research opportunities in quantum information and sensing based on emerging approaches including silicon and semiconductor-based qubits, macromolecules, conjugated molecular systems, and other experimental realizations. Workshop topics will include both top-down fabrication techniques and bottom-up methods that can offer atom-by-atom assembly for selected materials, ranging from sequential low-throughput approaches to higher-throughput methods enabled by classical semiconductor workflows and synthesis. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will serve as a forum to engage traditionally distinct communities whose common goal is to build quantum structures with near- and atomically precise fabrication and assembly in currently non-standard materials. It aims to address relatively less explored approaches to quantum information that are now enabled via advances via ML/AI, synthesis, and ion, electron, and beam probes. Topics to be covered will encompass silicon-based approaches that center around nuclear spins as well as electron spins; nuclear spins of donor atoms such as phosphorus and arsenic that require manipulation at the atomic scale; and fundamental research in manufacturing methods that will accomplish this. Other topics of interest include electron/hole spin-based approaches that utilize silicon as well as other semiconductors such as carbon nanotubes, and also fabrication technologies that are at the nanometer scale and need to be further developed. Macromolecules, and organic systems more generally, are also of interest since they encompass an exciting area of research that combines materials research, precise manipulation at molecular length scales, and studies of spin and quantum light generation. Both soft (organic) and hard matter (Ex. Carbon nanotube) pi-electron systems will be considered in the workshop. A broader outcome that is expected from the workshop is fostering of a collaborative ecosystem across multiple disciplines empowered to translate academic breakthroughs into scalable, real-world quantum technologies. \r\n\r\nSupport for the workshop is provided by the NSF Directorate for Engineering (ECCS, CMMI, EFMA) and the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (DMR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
