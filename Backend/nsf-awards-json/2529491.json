 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of a miniaturized in-ear blood pressure monitoring device. Current cuff-based blood pressure monitoring devices require proper positioning and although user training is inconvenient, it is required to avoid user error. Wearable blood pressure monitors (wrist, armband, and finger) are susceptible to inaccurate readings due to position and motion sensitivity. Wearable devices must be positioned at heart level for an accurate reading. In addition, most blood pressure devices lack automatic data logging and remote monitoring capability. This technology is a wearable form factor that may provide a stable and reliable location for blood pressure monitoring. The device is a hearing-aid-like earpiece that is designed for accurate and frequent blood pressure monitoring. This solution may be well suited for patients with hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and eclampsia. Such patients need frequent blood pressure monitoring, typically several times per day. This technology may offer a less disruptive alternative to cuff-based measurements and provide a more accurate way to monitor blood pressure frequently, which is important for improving health outcomes for patients with hypertension and related diseases.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a medical device to measure blood pressure. The ear is a preferred site for accurate blood pressure measurements due to its dense vascular structure, fewer motion artifacts, and fixed distance from the heart (as compared with cuff-based and other wearable blood pressure monitoring devices). This technology uses a light-based pulse sensor inserted gently into the ear canal, coupled with a digital air pump for precise control, and a blood pressure estimation algorithm. The device\u2019s sensor provides accurate systolic and diastolic blood pressure values and pulse rate by gradually inflating in the ear canal, without obstructing blood flow. The technology is based on a key finding that the pulse waveform can be detected through a sensing mechanism, and blood pressure can be identified through an algorithm without completely blocking the artery. In addition, the device may provide feedback to a mobile application, enabling users to track their blood pressure trends and receive artificial intelligence (AI)-generated insights for improved health management. The goal is to provide a more accurate and less disruptive solution for patients suffering from hypertension and related diseases that require frequent blood pressure monitoring.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
