 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of New Mexico (UNM) to enable pioneering research in large-volume optical microscopy using pupil-matched remote focusing (pmRF) techniques. This effort will develop advanced microscope systems that allow fast, high-resolution, and label-free imaging of large biological samples. Broader impacts include educational and outreach activities such as an intensive summer training program, an interdisciplinary microscopy course, and a regional undergraduate research event, UNM Physics Day. These efforts will involve undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, equipping them with practical skills in imaging and scientific computing. The project also emphasizes open hardware dissemination and community-centered technology sharing to broaden participation and promote transparency in scientific tool development. In doing so, the research supports workforce development, environmental health applications, and public scientific literacy.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research lies in its novel re-engineering of pmRF optics to overcome longstanding barriers in optical microscopy, such as limited imaging depth, mechanical instability, and slow acquisition speeds. Most microscopes struggle to image deeply or capture fast events in 3D because they rely on mechanically moving the sample. This research advances pupil-matched remote focusing (pmRF), a technique that instantly refocuses light within a sample using precisely aligned optics, eliminating the need for physical movement. The result is fast, minimally disruptive, and high-quality 3D imaging of intact biological systems. Building on this foundation, the project will explore label-free detection, deep-tissue imaging, and efficient strategies for large-scale volumetric scans. These next-generation tools will help researchers study complex biological systems with unprecedented detail and speed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
