 "awd_abstract_narration": "The AZ Cyber Pathways Research-Practice Partnership (RPP), under the preK-12 Pathway Strand, aims to address the pressing need for expanding the cybersecurity workforce in Arizona. In partnership with the Center for the Future of Arizona, Sunnyside Unified School District, and SRI International, this initiative seeks to develop coherent educational pathways that facilitate access to computer science and cyber careers. By fostering collaboration between educators, administrators, and students, the RPP will identify the skills and competencies essential for success in regional computing and cyber careers and create course sequences that align with these needs. Ultimately, the AZ Cyber Pathways RPP aims to empower students to pursue viable career pathways in cybersecurity, ensuring that they have the skills and resources necessary to thrive in this critical and rapidly evolving field. \r\n\r\nThe RPP is focused on exploratory research and the development of a partnership to produce knowledge about how to expand the cyber workforce. The project\u2019s key expected outcome is a collaborative that increases the capacity of K-14 practitioners to define, strategize, and implement evidence-based computer science and cyber pathways. The research comprises three areas: (1) supporting the development and maintenance of the partnership, (2) collecting and analyzing data to understand the regional context and labor market needs, and (3) synthesizing and reporting these data. Through cycles of research and continuous improvement, the RPP aims to develop evidence-based solutions that enhance curricular offerings and support systems for students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
