 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inverse problems are found in many areas of study, such as medical imaging, oil drilling, heat transfer, artificial intelligence, and bioengineering.  These problems involve determining the cause of measured effects; for example, using X-rays (the measurement) to decide whether a cancer tumor (the cause) exists.  Inverse problems symposia offer valuable platforms for researchers to share their results.  However, students often face financial constraints that limit their ability to attend such conferences.  This Inverse Problems Symposium 2025 will provide an opportunity for young researchers to present their work, forge connections with established experts in the field, get exposed to the importance of inverse problems, and see how these types of problems arise in various engineering applications.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to provide resources that enable students to participate in the 2025 Inverse Problems Symposium.  The symposium will be held at the Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center, Michigan State University on June 1-3, 2025.  It starts with a tutorial on machine learning on Sunday afternoon (June 1).  The keynote address on autonomous vehicles will be the first talk on Monday.  A student poster competition will be held Monday afternoon.   Single-session oral presentations will be given on Monday and Tuesday.  A banquet talk on Monday evening will be given on medical imaging.  The Symposium aims to support 12 students, looking to recruit upper-level undergraduate and graduate students.  Funding for students will allow them to showcase their research, see how it can be applied for industrial use, and connect with faculty or companies who are looking to recruit in the inverse problems area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
