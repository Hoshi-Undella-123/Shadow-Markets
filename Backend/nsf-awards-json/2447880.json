 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU Site: Interdisciplinary Research Experiences in Metrology & Inspection is hosted by Texas A&M University. The overarching goal is to enhance the knowledge and skill-levels of a cohort of undergraduate students through empowering, hands-on and interdisciplinary research experiences in both traditional/advanced metrology and destructive/non-destructive inspection technologies. Metrology is the science of measurement and inspection and transcends scales, materials, and disciplines. Ten students each year will participate in research projects featuring inline process monitoring of pharmaceutical additive manufacturing, forensic metrology of fractures in additive manufactured parts, lithium-ion battery performance, and additive manufacturing of copper alloys for heat exchangers. Engaging each student cohort in intentional metrology/inspection activities through inter-disciplinary research projects will help create empowered future researchers and a workforce that is well-rooted in metrology/inspection technologies. REU students will also explore career opportunities available to them through advanced STEM degrees and other associated careers.\r\n\r\nREU students will be immersed in hands-on research experiences comprised of a state-of-the-art research project, technical sessions, seminars, lab practice, field tours, and professional-development workshops. The REU site will advance scientific knowledge through inter-disciplinary research projects and especially help further the energy and manufacturing sectors. During the summer program, five vertically integrated teams (two REU students, one senior undergraduate, one graduate student and a faculty mentor) will work on selected research projects. Students will disseminate research results and create a follow-up plan tailored to each student's career interests. The overarching outcome of this project is to prepare students who, when faced with a technical problem, will learn to ask the right research questions, formulate an educated plan, use the resources available, analyze results, leverage the group collaboration, and grow as a researcher.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
