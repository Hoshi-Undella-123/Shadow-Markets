 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of advanced membrane materials for water treatment systems that are more durable, cost-effective, and efficient. Reverse osmosis membrane technologies are widely used in industries such as food and beverage processing, wastewater reclamation, chemical processing, power plants, and resource recovery, but they suffer from severe challenges due to the accumulation of mineral scale and organic foulants. These issues lead to frequent cleaning cycles, high energy consumption, and premature membrane failure. The solution under investigation offers a novel approach to reducing these maintenance costs while improving overall performance and lifespan. By improving operational reliability and decreasing dependence on chemical cleaning agents, the technology supports sustainability, industrial efficiency, and public health through improved water treatment practices. Implementation of this technology could significantly lower the cost and chemical footprint of industrial water purification processes, contributing to economic prosperity and resource conservation.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of ultra-thin polyamide reverse osmosis membranes fabricated via a rinse-free, molecular layer-by-layer deposition process. Unlike conventional interfacial polymerization methods that produce rough, heterogeneous surfaces prone to fouling and scaling, this technique yields smooth membranes with tunable thickness and surface chemistry. By optimizing monomer concentration and eliminating intermediate rinsing steps, the fabrication process is significantly faster and more sustainable. The membranes can be functionalized with antifouling or scale-resistant coatings without compromising salt rejection or water permeability. Early tests indicate exceptional resistance to mineral scaling and organic fouling, potentially extending cleaning intervals by a factor of three or more. This innovation offers a scalable path toward next-generation membranes that address longstanding performance and cost barriers in industrial water purification.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
