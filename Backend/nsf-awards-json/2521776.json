 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF travel award aims to support 10 students to travel to the 13th IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (IEEE ICHI 2025) at the University of Calabria in Italy. The funding will cover expenditures of the students, including registration, travel, and lodging. Those students will present their research work either as a presentation talk or poster presentation, providing them a valuable platform to connect with the community and promote their scientific career development. The students will have the valuable opportunity to receive research feedback, participate in roundtable discussions, and discuss career advice from internationally recognized experts through the three-day conference programs. This award will not only promote next-generation trainings of future leaders and workforce in health informatics but also strengthen valuable US-Europe research connections in the interdisciplinary field, contributing to health informatics research, education, and practice.\r\n\r\nIEEE ICHI 2025 serves as the premier community forum focusing on the application of computer science principles, information science principles, information technology, and communication technology to address problems in healthcare, public health, and everyday wellness. This travel grant will enable the students from the US institutions to engage deeply with the international scientific community through diverse programs of the IEEE ICHI-25, including research presentations, tutorials, keynotes, and workshops. The programs cover three major tracks, including analytics track, human factors track, and system track, which will highlight novel technical contributions in health informatics, computational healthcare, and bioinformatics to conference participants. The award will foster research collaborations and exposes the student participants to different disciplinary approaches and support networking with other conference attendees, aiming to promote next-generation workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
