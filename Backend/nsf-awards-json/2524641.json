 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Level 1 Implementation and Evaluation project at Moreno Valley College aims to provide hands-on learning experiences across multiple disciplines. The project will develop a broad collection of experiences centered on the conservation and restoration of monarch butterfly habitats.  STEM majors will participate in activities including the developing native habitats, plotting and planting seedlings, testing soils, observing wildlife, and gathering plant and insect data. The project will also improve the technical writing skills of humanities majors to support project dissemination through publications, presentations, and other outlets.\r\n\r\nInvolving students in authentic research experiences is a proven approach to strengthen engagement and realize stronger academic outcomes. This project further centers the work to support butterfly populations as an important part of students' local communities, encouraging them to become active, engaged citizens. Project research will explore how contributing to habitat restoration efforts through courses and independent efforts impact students and faculty. The project will be assessed by an independent evaluator who will provide formative and summative feedback to ensure progress towards stated goals. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and increase capacity to engage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM teaching and learning at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
