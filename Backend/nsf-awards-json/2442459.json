 "awd_abstract_narration": "The human brain depends on a vast network of tiny blood vessels to deliver the oxygen and nutrients that keep it functioning. Interruptions in blood flow are tied to various neurological conditions, including autism and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Studying how blood flows in animal brains during different activities could unlock new treatment approaches. However, today\u2019s imaging methods lack the ability to capture high-resolution images of blood flow changes in real-time, especially while animals perform tasks. This CAREER project seeks to bridge that gap with a new super-resolution imaging technique that can map brain activity in unprecedented detail by combining ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging. This new system will empower researchers to study how blood vessels respond to neurological abnormalities, deepening our understanding of brain disorders. The project will engage middle school students through a summer camp for focused on imaging sciences, interactive demos for K-12 students, and hands-on courses using real research data to expand the science and engineering workforce and train the next generation of imaging experts.\r\n\r\nThe primary research objective of this proposal is to create a multiparametric, high-resolution brain imaging platform that utilizes both photoacoustic (PA) and ultrasound localization (UL) imaging technologies. This new platform, termed Super-Resolution PAUL (sPAUL), will allow researchers to capture detailed images of cerebral blood flow, volume, and oxygenation in awake animals while they perform specific tasks. Specific objectives include enhancing photoacoustic oxygen imaging with co-registered ultrasound, translating PAUL signals into functional cerebrovascular maps in a behavior-compatible setup, and investigating the cerebral vascular response in rodent models of neurological disorders. The expected outcome of this research could reveal critical insights into the mechanisms behind many neurological conditions and lay the groundwork for new therapeutic approaches. A new graduate-level course on advanced imaging methods and a lecture series with a lifelong learning center will inspire a broad spectrum of individuals in the community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
