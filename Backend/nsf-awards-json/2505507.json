 "awd_abstract_narration": "This IRES project explores ways to implement new energy technologies that best meet society's needs by looking at Sweden's energy transition (SWEET) as an example. Through this project, cohorts of U.S. undergraduate and graduate students engage in collaborative and interdisciplinary research during five weeks each summer with faculty at Lule\u00e5 University of Technology in Sweden. The project considers business, policy, historical, and product-innovation perspectives as the students and faculty mentors examine new technologies and their impacts on jobs, housing, and overall well-being. The Swedish mentors work closely with local stakeholders in industry, government, and local communities to better understand quickly evolving energy innovations, community attitudes regarding energy technology, and the impacts of energy infrastructure on local populations and environments. Student participants are recruited by George Washington University faculty, who prepare them for the experience with training before their summer research trip, and work with them upon return to the U.S. to develop the research results into a set of best practices that can be applied in the American context, including articles for publication in peer-reviewed journals. This IRES experience contributes to developing globally informed, community-centered, and multidisciplinary research and critical analysis skills in a future generation of U.S. academic, industry, and policy leaders.\r\n\r\nNew energy technologies that are potentially cheaper and more efficient than existing fuels often have difficulty gaining community acceptance because they raise questions about implications for the workforce, housing availability, and environmental and social impacts. This research project develops a holistic understanding of the implementation of new energy technologies by leading a series of summer schools for American students in collaboration with the Lule\u00e5 University of Technology in northern Sweden. The SWEET student cohorts apply community-based research methodologies to examine how to implement new energy technologies that are beneficial to all members of society. By combining social science and engineering techniques, researchers can better understand both the benefits and risks of new energy technologies, and the technical feasibility of different implementation strategies. While there is substantial scientific literature on the technological innovations in the energy space, a gap remains in how social scientists, engineers, and community members can learn from each other to create a more effective and efficient transition. Outcomes of this IRES research project include changes in the way society conceives of, plans for, and develops alternative futures, while preparing students to approach these complex, multifaceted challenges. This early-career networking and research experience helps to prioritize community needs and priorities as well as holistic thinking about the challenges posed by a large societal transformation. By engaging with peers and faculty across disciplines, students learn how to apply a variety of research skills to complex energy issues while considering multiple perspectives and integrating several methodologies. Working with policymakers and local stakeholders, students are able to investigate how research can be co-produced alongside communities to be truly use-inspired.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
