 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) is committed to enhancing the quality of undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and research at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to expand participation in the nation's STEM workforce. HBCU-UP works toward this goal by providing awards to develop, implement, and study innovative approaches for making dramatic improvements in the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may participate successfully in graduate programs and/or careers in STEM disciplines. This HBCU-UP equipment award provides Alabama A&M University with funding to support the purchase of an Ultrahigh-Performance Liquid Chromatography System (UHPLC) with a Photodiode Array (PDA) detector for undergraduate research and training. The team will leverage their existing research capacities and utilize the new highly advanced instrument to separate, detect, and analyze the components of complex chemical mixtures. This important analytical instrument will play a crucial role in advancing scientific research and education across a wide range of disciplines, including biology, chemistry, food science, environmental science, and other STEM fields. \r\n\r\nIn addition to advancing research, the instrument will be fully integrated into undergraduate laboratory courses, providing all students with hands-on experience using industry-standard tools and analytical techniques. This initiative aims to inspire curiosity, support student-led inquiry, and better prepare students for successful careers or advanced study in STEM fields. This project provides critical equipment for research and instrumental analysis for students and faculty alike. The equipment will be made available to other researchers and students at Alabama A&M University, Oakwood University, local high schools, and partnering institutions, helping to train students by providing them with unique hands-on experiences. This equipment acquisition fosters collaboration, innovation, and knowledge exchange among HBCU students and faculty, ultimately driving progress in the realm of STEM education and research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
