 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation (IMSI) applies mathematics and statistics to important scientific problems, and works to increase engagement of mathematicians and statisticians in interdisciplinary approaches to these problems. The Institute aims to catalyze new mathematical and statistical approaches to further understanding of complex phenomena and issues of great societal interest. As part of its mission, IMSI facilitates rapid and effective dissemination of these advances to both the mathematical sciences research community and broader audiences. IMSI contributes to training a new generation of mathematicians and statisticians equipped to advance multidisciplinary research through immersion in the challenges encountered within and beyond the mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\nIMSI addresses major challenges facing society by building conduits from the core disciplines of mathematics and statistics to a broad range of disciplines and applications that need mathematical and statistical insights to understand the dynamics of data- and computation-intensive phenomena. At the same time, these interactions will help to enrich research in fundamental mathematics and statistics.  During programs ranging in length from a few days to several months, IMSI researchers immerse themselves in major projects, organized around themes, and driven by challenges in areas such as artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning, digital twins for complex systems, understanding the structure and function of the human brain, modeling traffic and transportation systems, quantum computing, and the design of new materials. Institute activities will contribute to scientific and technological innovation and national prosperity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
