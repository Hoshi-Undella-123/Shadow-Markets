 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a new technology to address two global challenges: access to clean water and detection of toxic heavy metals. The technology is called a dual-phase electrochemical system. This system integrates contaminant detection and desalination into a single, affordable platform. The technology will use redox-active polymers in a dual-phase electrochemical cell to remove salts. At the same time, it binds to toxic anions like arsenate and chromate in water to enable real-time detection.  The project combines materials science with electrochemical engineering to address both environmental and societal needs. In addition to the research focus, this project will train the undergraduate and graduate students in research. This effort supports broader participation in STEM fields, and strengthens the scientific workforce to address environmental challenges. The outcomes of the research may inform future technology development for emergency response systems, decentralized water treatment, and smart water monitoring platforms. \r\n\r\nThis Engineering Research Initiation project aims to develop a dual-phase redox-driven electrochemical system capable of simultaneously detecting heavy metals contamination and desalinating water. The system will leverage redox-active polymers to selectively capture arsenate and chromate, two contaminants commonly found in water, due to industrial activity and naturally occurring. The system is designed to separate the sensing and removal processes, reducing signal interference and improving efficiency. The project is structured around three research objectives: (1) evaluating the desalination performance of various redox-active polymers under operational conditions; (2) characterizing the binding interactions between these redox sites and target ions using electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; and (3) assessing the long-term electrochemical and structural stability of the materials under repeated cycling. To extend the system\u2019s electrochemical performance, the research will explore both organic and aqueous-modified electrolytes with attention to cost, safety, and feasibility. Stability studies will be conducted under both laboratory and field-simulated conditions to evaluate the durability of the materials over time. The system is being designed for simplicity, portability, and compatibility with integrated real-time sensing. The platform may also be adapted for other water contaminants, broadening its future impact. Additionally, the project supports capacity building at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag\u00fcez through hands-on training in electrochemical methods, materials characterization, and water treatment technologies. Undergraduate and graduate students will be directly involved. This initiative will help prepare a skilled workforce equipped to tackle environmental challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
