 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of early career U.S.-based researchers in the \u201cInternational Workshop on Applied Probability: Probability, Statistics and their Applications (IWAP 2025),\u201d which will take place June 9-13, 2025 in SAS Hall of North Carolina State University. In light of the many applications of probability and statistics in public policy, decision theory, social and health sciences and various scientific fields, the conference will offer a platform for advancing new statistical and mathematical methodologies and computational procedures. In addition to research presentations, there will be ample networking opportunities throughout the event, helping to facilitate the exchange of ideas. Thus, while the funding will primarily support students and participants with recent Ph.D.\u2019s, and will help to educate and bring them to the forefront of this active and important research area, the conference will be beneficial for all of the approximately 50 to 60 workshop participants that are expected.\r\n\r\nThe conference will consist of eight plenary talks given by top researchers. There will also be both invited and contributed sessions. Topics that will be presented include scan statistics, graphs/networks, statistical machine learning, variable selection and quantum computing, with applications to such areas as genomics, chemistry, individualized treatment regimes in medical research, network traffic, economic forecasting, medical imaging, cluster, anomaly and change point detection, and forecasting tourist arrivals. See https://iwap2025.weebly.com/ for more information about IWAP 2025.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
