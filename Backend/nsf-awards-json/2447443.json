 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the Smithsonian-Mason School of Conservation, located at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, VA, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2026- 2028.\u202f Undergraduate students will have the opportunity to conduct hands-on conservation research and gain career-ready skills to develop the best management practices for the conservation of threatened species, with the goal of helping to alleviate species extinction globally.\u202f The REU connects students with the greater conservation community as they meet and network with researchers in the field, develop career skills, and share results on how their research can inform and impact species conservation.\u202f Student projects will aid in their development of field and lab research methods, data collection, management, and analysis, all of which are necessary skills for future careers in science.\u202f Students will enhance their communication skills by presenting the results of their work at a final symposium and other scientific conferences.\u202fStudents should apply to the REU site using NSF ETAP (Education and Training Application) at https://etap.nsf.gov. \r\n\r\nStudents will work with a mentor to develop an original inquiry-based research project within one of three conservation focal areas: 1) assessing and monitoring species in the wild, 2) understanding ecological integrity and species resilience to environmental threats, and 3) improving captive management of threatened species. \u202fThis REU takes advantage of the resources offered by the Smithsonian-Mason School of Conservation, located at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, which provides opportunities to learn and conduct research onsite in laboratories and at nearby field sites (forests, wetlands, and meadows). \u202fStudents will be trained in the responsible and ethical conduct of research and participate in professional development and skills-building seminars.\u202f They will also attend colloquium talks given by experts in conservation while interacting with peers to develop teamwork skills and networks. \u202fSuccessful applicants will be paired with a research mentor based on their interest in this REU\u2019s thematic areas and the best fit of the REU experience for the student\u2019s academic and/or professional or career goals. A list of available projects and associated mentors can be found here: https://smconservation.gmu.edu/nsf-reu/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
