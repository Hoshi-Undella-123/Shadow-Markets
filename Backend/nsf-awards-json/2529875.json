 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bioluminescence, the process by which living organisms produce visible light through chemical reactions, is widespread in nature. However, many bioluminescent systems remain unexplored, and purifying and determining the properties of their light-emitting proteins could catalyze both fundamental and applied research. This project aims to characterize and engineer novel photoproteins recently discovered in bioluminescent marine organisms, expanding the repertoire of known photoproteins. Undergraduate students will gain hands-on training in high-impact research, yielding peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and fieldwork experience. The captivating theme of bioluminescence will anchor outreach activities, allowing the community to explore the biological mechanisms and ecological roles of light production, conduct luminescent-protein experiments, and investigate real-world biotechnological applications. Key elements of the project will also be integrated into biochemistry and biophysics courses.\r\n\r\nCalcium-regulated photoproteins emit light upon binding calcium ions, offering an efficient alternative to fluorescence-based methods for studying intracellular calcium dynamics. Despite their broad applicability, only a limited number of these photoproteins have been isolated from bioluminescent organisms. This research project aims to characterize and engineer novel calcium-regulated photoproteins recently discovered in bioluminescent siphonophores, marine invertebrates known for their ability to produce light. Functional properties of this novel photoprotein group will be assessed across siphonophore species using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, RNA sequencing, quantitative light-emission assays, and X-ray crystallography. The project also seeks to engineer enhanced photoproteins through mutagenesis and computational modeling to optimize calcium sensitivity and spectral properties. The long-term outcome of this research is to advance our understanding of fundamental bioluminescent mechanisms and drive innovation in calcium imaging and reporter technologies by generating photoproteins with tailored properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
