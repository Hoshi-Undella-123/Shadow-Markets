 "awd_abstract_narration": "The SLMath Institute (SLMath), formerly MSRI, plays a prominent role in contributing to the world\u2019s mathematical infrastructure through its role as a leading national collaborative mathematical research institute. SLMath's mission is to: 1) foster and communicate mathematical research in a broad range of fundamental topics and applications, 2) develop mathematical talent and cultivate a sense of belonging and engagement, and 3) inspire an appreciation of the power, beauty, and joy of mathematics. SLMath\u2019s overarching goal is to enable research in the mathematical sciences by researchers at all stages in their careers. The Institute engages and welcomes mathematical scientists from a wide range of institutions and organizations, facilitating access to innovative and engaging mathematics, providing collaboration spaces, and supporting the needs of participants. The expected impacts include the expansion of research at the frontiers of knowledge by bringing together the most creative mathematical scientists across generations; the advancement of fundamental mathematics informed by the contributions of researchers from a comprehensive range of institutions; and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals with the critical skills needed to drive economic growth and ensure national security.\r\n\r\nThe number of programs, together with their breadth, highlight the Institute\u2019s intellectual impact on the mathematical community. During the academic year, SLMath hosts semester, month-long programs and various workshops that showcase cutting edge, innovative mathematics. SLMath also runs several summer programs. The Summer Graduate Schools are unique in that they provide opportunities for graduate students across the US to explore areas of the mathematical sciences not usually addressed in graduate school courses. In addition, the new summer research program, PROOF, seeks to provide research opportunities for mathematicians, statisticians, and their collaborators who have heavy teaching loads, lack funding, or have other professional constraints. This summer program will also seek to attract researchers from EPSCoR states. Collectively, these programs bring together distinct multigenerational mathematical communities and provide transformative research opportunities under the guidance of the world\u2019s most creative scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
