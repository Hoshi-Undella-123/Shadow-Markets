 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will support student travel to participate in the Project Connect program during the 2025 IEEE International Microwave Symposium, which will be held in San Francisco, CA on June 15-20, 2025. The conference is the largest flagship meeting of microwave engineering in IEEE, the world's largest professional society covering multiple fields in electrical and electronics engineering. The conference has a long history started in 1957 and now includes an industry exhibition of several hundred companies developing products or providing services in wireless and semiconductor industries. The week-long conference features plenary and invited talks, paper presentation sessions, interactive poster sessions, workshops, tutorials, panels, student design competitions, and many social networking events. The conference attracts several thousand attendees each year from industry, academia and government research labs to share research findings, foster collaborations, and identify new directions for research and development.\r\n\r\nThe Project Connect program will include a variety of activities to help student participants build their network with other professionals in the technical community. The travel support of this project will provide students many exciting opportunities to learn the state-of-the-art technology advancements and interact with potential mentors in the microwave and wireless technological areas covering a wide range of spectrum from megahertz to terahertz. The project aims to develop the technical interests of the student participants, motivating them to be involved in undergraduate research and to pursue further studies in graduate programs. Through the Project Connect program, the student participants will develop a successful long-term professional career and contribute to the U.S. STEM workforce in the critical areas using advanced microwave and wireless technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
