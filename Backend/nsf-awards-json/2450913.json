 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in advancing the development of CATOS-AI (Cancer Treatment Optimization Solutions \u2013 Artificial Intelligence) towards integration with healthcare-IT systems, paving the way for commercialization after completing key milestones in the Phase I project. By leveraging a strong collaboration between academia and industry experts, this project aims to enhance the global competitiveness of this innovative technology, addressing a critical need in precision oncology. The anticipated outcomes include substantial improvements in personalized cancer care and accelerated development of new drug options, leading to better survival rates for cancer patients while reducing time and costs. Additionally, the software is expected to benefit millions of cancer patients by improving the quality of care, supporting pharmaceutical research and development, and alleviating the overall healthcare burden. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to build a powerful artificial intelligence (AI) based clinical decision-making tool called CATOS-AI (Cancer Treatment Optimization Solutions \u2013 Artificial Intelligence) for personalized cancer care. Addressing the need for advanced AI solutions in precision oncology and drug repositioning, the project will utilize machine learning and multi-omics analysis to discover new drugs or repurpose existing ones for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. It will also develop predictive models using de-identified genomic data to assess tumor recurrence, metastasis risks, and patient responses to both standard treatments and off-label drugs. Additionally, the CATOS-AI will simulate nanoparticle-based drug delivery methods to optimize administration strategies for new and repurposed therapies. The project further includes the development of a cloud-based clinical software platform with robust data security, privacy protection, and tiered access for users, ensuring its usability in real-world clinical and research settings. This SBIR Phase II effort will advance CATOS-AI into a comprehensive AI-powered platform, accelerating drug discovery, improving cancer treatment outcomes, and enhancing accessibility to precision medicine solutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
