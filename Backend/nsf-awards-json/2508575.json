 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Research Initiation: Mixed Methods Study of Rural Engineering Students' Sense of Belonging at a Midwestern Research-Intensive University\r\n\r\nThis project aims to serve national priorities by initiating research on the professional formation of engineers and supporting pathways into and through engineering for students with varied backgrounds, interests, and experiences. Meeting evolving workforce needs requires not only more engineers but professionals whose perspectives reflect a spectrum of experiences, including those shaped by rural communities. Research universities play a vital role in cultivating the next generation of engineering talent. However, fostering environments where students can thrive requires more than simply providing access\u2014it also requires a sense of belonging. For many, feeling connected is essential to staying engaged and persisting in their studies. When that connection is lacking, the risk of leaving the field increases, limiting opportunity and reducing the breadth of ideas that drive innovation. Despite this, little research has examined how rural engineering students experience belonging at large universities\u2014a gap this project will address. This National Science Foundation Research Initiation in Engineering Formation (RIEF) award to the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison and Clemson University will explore rural engineering students\u2019 sense of belonging and identify opportunities to strengthen connectedness. Using surveys followed by in-depth interviews, the research will gather rich, first-hand accounts to contribute new knowledge about varied experiences in engineering education. These insights will inform efforts to improve retention and help ensure that talented students from all communities can advance into engineering careers. This study aligns with the goals of the NSF RIEF program by advancing innovative research on engineering formation while strengthening the capacity of early-career faculty to lead impactful educational studies. Ultimately, the findings will support a more resilient engineering workforce enriched by a broad range of perspectives.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this research are to explore rural engineering students\u2019 sense of belonging, identify opportunities to improve connectedness, and develop monitoring programs and targeted interventions for students at risk of leaving the engineering pipeline. The study will address three research questions: (1) What factors influence a student's self-identification as rural and how strongly do they identify with their rural background or experiences? (2) In what ways does this identification shape their college experience, environment, and sense of belonging? (3) How can institutions better support students in strengthening their sense of belonging earlier in their college journey? A mixed-methods approach will begin with a quantitative survey available to all students. All students will be included and participants will indicate whether they consider themselves to have rural backgrounds or experiences, and those who self-identify as rural will be included in the analysis. Allowing students to define rurality in their own terms will yield nuanced insights into how rural identity relates to their experiences. Survey findings will guide the selection of participants for follow-up semi-structured interviews to gather in-depth qualitative data. Analysis will draw on social identity theory, ecological systems theory, and belongingness theory to build a multidimensional understanding of these factors. Expected outcomes include evidence-based strategies and tools to help institutions create supportive environments, identify students at risk of disengagement, and implement targeted interventions. More broadly, this work will inform and support efforts to expand opportunities for aspiring engineers by deepening understanding of how identity influences pathways into and through engineering education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
