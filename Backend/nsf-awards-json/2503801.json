 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides U.S. students with first-rated research experience in composite materials through combined training and mentorship at the University of Akron and in world renowned laboratories at several partner universities in Japan. The project makes provisions for 18 undergraduate and graduate students to spend 8-weeks each summer for 3 years at the University of Tokyo, Tokyo University of Agricultural and Technology, and Nagoya University. This international research opportunity exposes U.S. students to global mindsets and learning ecosystems to pick up knowledge and skills from the best in the field of composite materials. The students conduct research on recycling of composite materials with focus on long term use, lower costs, and energy efficient processes. The students prepare for the international trip through laboratory training at the University of Akron on designing, manufacturing, and testing of composites. They also gain basic Japanese language skills and cross-cultural understanding to help them adapt more quickly during their overseas training. In conjunction, the students visit selected U.S. composite companies and national laboratories to learn about and get oriented on the trends and applications of composite materials in commercial and national needs. Students trained through this project contribute to enhancing the competitiveness of U.S. companies and supporting national interests through work with federal agencies. The students receive ongoing career guidance and research mentorship from both U.S. and Japanese professors to advance their undergraduate or graduate level research projects and develop expertise and leadership skills in the field of composite materials.\r\n\r\nThrough world-class collaborative research experience supplemented with exposure to an international work environment in Japan for Advancing Sustainable Technology And Recycling for composite materials (J-A*STAR), participating U.S. students engage in the latest composite research such as additive manufacturing using data-driven approaches, digital twin in hydrogen energy storage system, recycling technology for circular economy, and using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to detect damage and lengthen the lifespan of composite materials deployed in aerospace, automotive, and energy applications. Specific objectives of this project are: (1) To establish students' knowledge of the latest research and development in composite materials that can secure carbon-neutrality through intimate interaction with international experts in U.S. and Japan; (2) To cultivate students' awareness of international scientific community and global market competition through exposing U.S. students to world-class research environment, facilities, and equipment; and (3) To develop students' knowledge and skillsets and prepare them for global leadership roles in the composite field through collaboration with international experts, pursuing graduate research training and joining workforce in U.S. companies and federal agencies. The approaches include these key elements: (a) well-structured mentorship for U.S. students through a collaborative network of U.S. and Japanese researchers; (b) active participation in composite materials research to address critical global challenges, supported by a world-class research environment and facilities at national research institutions in the U.S. and Japan; (c) a multi-disciplinary laboratory training program offered by local U.S. mentors in the areas of mechanical engineering, polymer engineering, polymer science, and computer science; (d) webinars and seminars on Japanese language/culture and training on a safe, diverse, multicultural research environment to prepare students; (e) pre-trip visits and post-trip career opportunities at composite companies and federal laboratories; (f) post-trip professional development on career guidance, graduate research study, and professional skillsets; (g) research dissemination activities through \"J-STAR Day at UA\", presentation in professional conferences and publication in open-access journals; and (h) an online community of practice to connect students with international experts and mentors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
