 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to broaden U.S. student participation at the 2025 ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Machine Learning for Computer-Aided Design (MLCAD), a premier conference at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and electronic design automation (EDA). Since its inception in 2019, MLCAD has evolved into a key technical forum for researchers and engineers exploring the use of ML techniques in all aspects of electronic system design. Jointly sponsored by ACM and IEEE, and supported by leading industry sponsors, MLCAD has grown in both attendance and impact, becoming a central venue for \r\nadvancing interdisciplinary innovation. Funding from this proposal will support the travel and registration costs of U.S.-based undergraduate and graduate students, enabling them to attend MLCAD 2025 in Santa Cruz, California. Students will have the opportunity to present their research, participate in a contest, poster sessions, attend invited talks and panels, and engage directly with academic and industry experts. These experiences \u2014delivered in a focused, small-format setting \u2014 are critical for career development and \r\nfor fostering the next generation of ML EDA researchers. \r\n\r\nMLCAD 2025 will be the seventh edition of the symposium, continuing its mission to advance ML techniques for chip design and EDA. The program includes peer-reviewed papers, special sessions, panels, and structured student-centered activities \u2014 all supported by academic and industry collaboration. This NSF travel grant will fund approximately 10 U.S.-based students. Priority will be given to students who are actively participating in MLCAD\u2019s student-focused activities, which include (1) ReSynthAI Contest \u2013 \r\na logic resynthesis competition using ML techniques to improve timing under physical design constraints, and (2) Artifact Evaluation (AE) \u2013 a reproducibility initiative where students submit code, data, and models of their papers for peer review and badging. Applicants will be evaluated based on participation in student activities, financial need, and academic merit. The travel grant will cover registration, airfare, lodging, and local transportation, enabling students to participate fully and benefit from direct interaction with leaders in ML and semiconductor design.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
