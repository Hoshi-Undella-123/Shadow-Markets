 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to transform techncial education in cell therapy biomanufacturing by preparing two-year college students for high-demand, high-wage careers in an emerging biotechnology sector. The project develops innovative, hands-on training modules that equip students with advanced technical skills for operating cutting-edge biomanufacturing equipment and following cleanroom protocols. Collaboration with leading industry partners ensures that rigorous skill standards are integrated into courses, strengthening efforts to maintain a competitive biotechnology workforce and drive economic growth. This forward-thinking approach aims to enhance science literacy, technical proficiency, and best practices in technical education, focusing on training future professionals in manufacturing life-saving therapeutics.\r\n\r\nThe project advances technical education in cell therapy biomanufacturing through a structured, four-phase approach with clear goals and scope. In the \"Identify and Map\" phase, the Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) model and industry advisory committees will refine advanced cell therapy skills standards, systematically mapping them to stackable credentials aligned with industry roles. The \"Translate and Create\" phase will convert the standards into theoretical and practical training modules covering advanced cell culture, biomanufacturing equipment operation, cleanroom protocols, and quality assurance. During \"Pilot and Execute,\" pilot programs with educators and students will test and refine the curriculum through iterative evaluations based on surveys, focus groups, and quantitative data. The final phase, \"Share and Communicate,\" will disseminate findings through webinars and national education networks. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
