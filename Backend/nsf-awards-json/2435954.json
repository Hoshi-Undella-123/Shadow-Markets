 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a workshop organized by The National Humanities Alliance Foundation and the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) for approximately 25 attendees that brings together humanities scholars, their collaborators from STEM fields, and policymakers and funders to discuss the role of the humanities in multi-disciplinary projects that address ecological challenges. The workshop focuses on a broad range of projects that depend on the collaboration between the humanities and STEM fields. The aims include collecting information on types of projects, networks, funders, publication outlets, and policy impacts and to develop best practices for cultivating and sustaining these types of projects. A white paper will be produced and broadly disseminated. This project benefits societal welfare by helping to expand discussion and investigation of important current scientific issues to include the perspectives of humanities scholars.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is a one-day in-person workshop, following an open Call for Proposals. Workshop participants will come from a variety of identities and backgrounds, project types, disciplines, methodologies, career statuses, and experiences. The workshop day includes lightning talks, whole-group discussion, and small-group discussions. A post-workshop survey will evaluate the experiences of participants and value of the workshop. A white paper will be disseminated widely through various networks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
