 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Chicago Botanic Garden (CBG), located in Glencoe, IL, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2025- 2027. Through participation in research and professional development activities, students will gain foundational knowledge and skills for careers in plant biology and conservation while making meaningful contributions to CBG\u2019s plant science research program. By 2050, tens of thousands of plant species could be lost worldwide, with approximately one-third of U.S. species at risk. Despite plants being essential for air, food, shelter, clean water, and medicine, plant conservation receives significantly less attention than animal conservation. Simultaneously, a shortage of plant scientists and a decline in plant science degree programs have created a critical need for expertise in the field. This REU program helps address this gap by training the next generation of plant scientists as they contribute to CBG\u2019s renowned research and conservation efforts. Additionally, the program is a key component of a broader educational initiative that connects public high school students, REU undergraduates, and graduate students under the mentorship of Garden scientists. This integration enhances learning across levels by fostering student interest and providing leadership opportunities for advanced students. Participants will develop essential research skills and have opportunities to present their findings at scientific conferences. Program assessment will be conducted using surveys such as the Bio REU Common Assessment Tool. Students should apply to the REU site using NSF ETAP (Education and Training Application: https://etap.nsf.gov). \r\n\r\nAs part of the Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation Science and Action at CBG, this REU focuses on the integrated understanding, management, and conservation of plants and associated organisms. Working alongside CBG researchers and graduate student mentors, students will conduct research projects spanning genetic studies \u2013 such as assessing the genetic diversity of living collections of rare plant species - to ecosystem-level studies, including the use of remotely sensed geospatial data to examine drivers of urban plant health. Participants will take a lead role in their research, present their findings at a research symposium, and mentor high school students involved in CBG educational programs. To further support their professional growth and career readiness, students will participate in  professional development activities that develop skills in research and science communication, responsible conduct in research, and interdisciplinary research relevant to conservation careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
