 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) possess many critical qualities and characteristics associated with success in computing fields. Studies have shown that post-secondary graduation rates for students with ASD are lower than the general student population. Several studies have identified underdeveloped verbal/non-verbal communication abilities and social skills as significant factors to these attrition rates. The goal of the Neurodiversity Research Innovation Experience (NEURODRiVE) program is to support students so that they can successfully pursue and obtain employment in computing fields. Special attention will be given to creating workforce opportunities for Palm Beach State College (PBSC) students diagnosed with ASD, as this underutilized talent pool is of strategic importance to Florida. By providing tailored support and immersive learning experiences, NEURODRiVE will improve educational and employment outcomes for all PBSC students. \r\n\r\nThe project team will leverage the power of incorporated technologies that provide progressive, scaffolded experiences leading to real-world relationships in academic and career settings. The program will expose students to customized AR/VR modules where they will learn to navigate verbal/non-verbal communication and social skills in simulated workplace situations. The program will encourage participants to evaluate, critique, and present their AR/VR module experience to practice peer-to-peer communication skills. Industry partners will participate in the development of simulated job interviews in a VR environment to assist students in familiarizing and preparing for internships and job interviews. PBSC will work with local industry partners to provide internships for participating students. The project team will provide \u201cflip-side mentorship\u201d training for faculty and industry partners on evidence-based communication techniques that support student success in the classroom, and the workplace. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
