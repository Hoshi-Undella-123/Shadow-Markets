 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to explain how mechanical forces inside the body help shape developing tissues during early stages of life. By studying how cells move and interact with each other, and how mechanical forces guide their behaviors during tissue formation, this project will help explain how our organs and body structures take shape. To do this, the research team will combine knowledge and tools from several fields, including biology and engineering, which may also lead to new technologies useful in other areas of science and medicine. Beyond research, this project includes educational and outreach efforts to benefit students of all backgrounds. The research team will engage students at different educational levels and with all backgrounds. Hands-on activities and demonstrations will introduce these students to the importance of science and engineering, inspiring them to consider careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). Undergraduate students from all backgrounds will have opportunities to participate in this research, while new training programs and courses will prepare graduate students to work across scientific disciplines and solve complex biological problems.\r\n\r\nThe formation of tissue boundaries during development is essential for generating the diverse body structures and functions observed across living organisms. Mechanical forces play a critical role in shaping these boundaries by coordinating the spatial organization, morphology, and differentiation of cells within developing tissues. Among developmental processes, somitogenesis serves as an ideal model for studying the biomechanics of tissue boundary formation. However, investigating the biomechanics of somitogenesis in mammalian embryos remains challenging. To overcome this limitation, this project employs an integrative approach that combines a stem cell-based model of somite development with live imaging, biomechanical measurements, perturbation experiments, and theoretical and computational modeling. This multidisciplinary strategy will advance three key areas. First, it will establish a human-relevant in vitro model to enhance our understanding of somite formation during early development. Second, it will elucidate how mechanical forces and cellular behaviors drive the formation of somite boundaries, potentially shedding light on the origins of musculoskeletal deformities and vertebral malformations. Third, by integrating experimental biomechanics with theoretical and computational models, the project will uncover fundamental mechanical principles governing tissue morphogenesis. This approach will enable more accurate predictions, reveal emergent behaviors, and offer a comprehensive view of the biomechanical processes shaping biological structures across scales.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
