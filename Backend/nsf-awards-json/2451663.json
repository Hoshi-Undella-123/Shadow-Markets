 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of an innovative platform for preparing DNA samples for long-read sequencing technologies. These technologies offer unprecedented insights into complex genetic structures and their connections to health and disease but require long, continuous DNA strands for optimal performance. Current sample preparation methods are labor-intensive and expensive, and often compromise DNA quality and length, limiting the utility and adoption of long-read sequencers. This project\u2019s automated platform will deliver high quality DNA samples with improved reproducibility, reduced preparation time, and lower costs. Beyond advancing long-read sequencing, the platform will also support DNA preparation for other sequencing (next-generation sequencing) and analytical methods, broadening its impact. The sequencing sample preparation market is a large and rapidly growing market (annual growth rate of 13.4%), with long-read sequencing currently comprising ~10% of the total market. By overcoming critical barriers, this innovation will accelerate the adoption of long-read sequencing, drive market growth, and contribute to improved health outcomes through enhanced diagnostics and research capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to resolve a major challenge in genomic sequencing by advancing a novel technology for high-quality DNA sample preparation. Building on successful Phase I outcomes, the project focuses on developing commercial-grade prototypes and refining an automated platform for preparing long DNA strands. Key research objectives include fabricating user-friendly cartridges and instruments, improving platform performance, and validating the technology with input from leading research institutions. The approach utilizes a process that selectively traps genomic material in a microscale flow cell, where an electric field and pressure-driven flow work in tandem to enable purification and preparation within a single device. By the conclusion of Phase II, the project aims to deliver fully operational prototypes optimized for commercialization. These innovations are expected to streamline sample preparation, significantly reducing time, cost, and complexity while enhancing outcomes. The resulting technology will support broader adoption of long-read sequencing and other genomic applications, unlocking new possibilities in research, healthcare, and diagnostics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
