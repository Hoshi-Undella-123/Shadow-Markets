 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports the development of a program that aims to broaden participation of undergraduate students in research and education in the field of advanced network and computing technologies. Hosted at the Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), the program leverages the NSF-funded FABRIC testbed, a cutting-edge network research instrument that spans 33 U.S. and international sites and integrates high-performance computing, storage, and networking resources. The program is designed to provide students a world-class, immersive, hands-on research experience in many important emerging technology areas of national importance, including computer networking, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence applications. By providing research training and professional development opportunities that are often inaccessible to students at less-resourced institutions, this project seeks to foster a more robust STEM research workforce. Students are introduced to the broader scientific community and mentored in research communication, collaboration, and career planning, helping to inspire future scientists and engineers while expanding the impact and accessibility of NSF\u2019s research infrastructure investments.\r\n\r\nThe REU Site program is divided into two phases: a 3-week \u201cCore\u201d curriculum and a 6-week mentored research experience. The Core phase builds foundational knowledge in networking, programming, systems, and cyberinfrastructure, with hands-on tutorials using the FABRIC platform. During the Research phase, students are paired with mentors from UNC and partnering institutions to conduct independent research on advanced topics such as federated learning, in-band network telemetry, network security using P4 and FPGAs, AI-assisted medical imaging, and performance evaluation of congestion control algorithms. Students benefit from a layered mentoring structure that includes faculty, research staff, graduate students, and peer cohorts, creating a supportive and collaborative learning environment. Long-term engagement is supported through alumni tracking and community-building activities. By combining rigorous research training with sustained mentorship, this REU Site offers a scalable model for preparing students from all backgrounds to pursue graduate education and contribute to the future of multidisciplinary cyberinfrastructure research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
