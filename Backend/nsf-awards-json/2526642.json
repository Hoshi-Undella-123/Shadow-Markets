 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of an innovative battery modeling software tool to meet various simulation scenarios and customer requirements. The increasing demand for enhanced electric vehicle performance places significant requirements on battery design and battery management systems, particularly in accurately and efficiently predicting battery states, capacity, and aging conditions. The solution helps to accelerate the design of battery cells and packs, facilitate their integration into electric vehicles, and improve their performance during operation. The technique being commercialized will facilitate the design of high-performance batteries that are essential for electric vehicles and other applications, addressing critical global energy and environmental challenges.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a robust, efficient, and versatile battery simulation software to foster innovation across a wide range of battery design and application needs, including battery cell design, battery pack design, life estimation, and battery management design. This software technology has several unique features, including building on advanced, validated physics-based battery degradation models; offering superior prediction accuracy and reliability across various conditions; providing a cost-effective solution to reduce development and deployment costs; and supporting a wide range of applications, including lithium-ion and emerging solid-state batteries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
