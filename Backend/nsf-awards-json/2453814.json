 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microburst precipitation is a key loss mechanism for electrons in the Earth\u2019s inner magnetosphere and a significant energy source for the ionosphere. Chorus waves play a crucial role in driving electron microbursts. This study employs a simulation model to quantify microburst generation by chorus waves. The project will have a broader impact on human communication, as electron microbursts enhance ionospheric electron density, altering conductivity and consequently affecting communication signals. The project will support a scientist who obtained a PhD in 2021 and a graduate student. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to quantify electron microbursts driven by chorus waves and to investigate their temporal and spatial evolution using a self-consistent simulation model. The study has three scientific objectives: 1) identify the dominant mechanism for electron microburst formation, 2) characterize the temporal evolution of electron microbursts, and 3) determine the spatial characteristics and dependencies of electron microbursts. To achieve these goals, General Curvilinear Particle-In-Cell (GCPIC) simulations in a dipole field will be performed. The motion of resonant electrons will be analyzed, with a focus on nonlinear physical processes. Electron microbursts will be quantified in both the meridian plane and an L-shell-fixed surface, and their spatial scale dependence will be examined. Simulation results will be validated through microburst observations from the Electron Loss and Fields Investigation (ELFIN) satellite.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
