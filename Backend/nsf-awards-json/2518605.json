 "awd_abstract_narration": "This BRIDGE-QC training project addresses the nationwide shortage of professionals in Quantum Information Science (QIS) and the limited regional presence in this rapidly emerging field. QIS is advancing quickly, with transformative applications in sensing, computing, and networking. However, the United States faces a critical workforce gap in QIS and has called for intensified efforts to attract, educate, and develop a robust quantum workforce. Despite these national efforts, the educational infrastructure and research ecosystem needed to train quantum scientists remain nascent. BRIDGE-QC aims to meet the national demand for a quantum-ready workforce while also expanding opportunities in the field.\r\n\r\nBRIDGE-QC has two primary goals: (1) to develop a highly skilled quantum computing workforce by training students as quantum users, researchers, and contributors; and (2) to build and sustain a talent pipeline. The project takes a hands-on, interdisciplinary, and collaborative approach, creating a dynamic learning environment that combines formal coursework with informal, student-driven experiences. Core activities include new course development: Introduction to Quantum Computing and Quantum Algorithms and Applications, and the establishment of a quantum computing minor open to students across disciplines. To foster early engagement, BRIDGE-QC recruits high-achieving sophomores and juniors through Clemson's Creative Inquiry program and the Undergraduate Research Experience, and supports student-led initiatives such as the Quantum Club and Quantathons to promote community and partnerships with industry and research institutions. The project will deliver a comprehensive set of educational materials, including lecture notes, labs, onboarding modules, tutorials, source code, and scholarly publications. These resources will be publicly accessible and disseminated to support broad adoption at the state, regional, and national levels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
