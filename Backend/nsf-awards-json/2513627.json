 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been recognized for major contributions to particle physics, including the discovery of the Higgs boson. Continued efforts are being made to explore new physics, preserve and share data openly, and train the next generation of scientists. At Bethel University, contributions are being made to this mission through searches for new physics, development of the CMS open science platform, and educational activities. Undergraduate students are being trained for future scientific work through hands-on research and outreach activities, such as upgraded detector assembly work, developing open data tutorials, and presenting interactive demonstrations of particle physics concepts.\r\n\r\nThe Bethel group is conducting searches for vector-like quarks (VLQs), heavy fermions predicted in several extensions of the Standard Model. One analysis using early Run 3 data studies VLQ pair production with exotic decays via off-shell leptoquarks to final states with four tau leptons\u2014an unexplored signature at CMS. Another search is being developed for more conventional VLQ decays to W, Z, Higgs, or third-generation quarks, with the goal of obtaining sensitivity above 1.5 TeV using all of the data collected during Run 3 of the LHC. Both searches intend to use Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction to describe the properties of the VLQs, and will explore reconstruction using graph-based and attention-based machine learning techniques. Additional efforts include leadership in CMS data preservation and open access initiatives, assembly of the upgraded endcap calorimeter for the High-Luminosity LHC, and development of public-facing data and outreach tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
