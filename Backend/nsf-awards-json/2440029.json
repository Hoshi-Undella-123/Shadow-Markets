 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nModern materials must be both adaptive and multifunctional, yet most synthetic surfaces lack the ability to dynamically change in response to external forces. This research will investigate two-dimensional (2D) materials that combine viscous and elastic properties, allowing them to reorganize, self-heal, and transform under mechanical stress. By coupling soft polymer networks with thin membranes, this project will develop a new class of 2D materials with tunable mechanical and material properties. These materials could enable self-repairing coatings, smart membranes for filtration, and responsive biomedical interfaces. Beyond research, this project will integrate education through public speaking workshops, helping students communicate complex scientific ideas to broad audiences. The project will also provide research and communication training for undergraduate students who will become future leaders in the STEM workforce. By advancing both fundamental materials science and STEM workforce, this work will support the National Science Foundation\u2019s mission to promote scientific progress and national prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nThis research program will investigate the mechanics and phase behavior of 2D materials that combine viscous and elastic properties under nonequilibrium forces. Specifically, it will study how active forces reshape multiphase lipid membranes coupled to driven polymer networks, forming dynamic composite materials with tunable properties. While the behavior of bulk active materials is well-studied, the interplay between viscoelasticity and active flows in confined 2D surfaces remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, this research will integrate experimental and theoretical approaches to uncover how local stresses drive structural transformations in phase-separating 2D surfaces. Experimental efforts will focus on engineering lipid-polymer membranes, generating active forces using actin-myosin networks, and analyzing microstructure evolution through advanced microscopy techniques. Theoretical work will develop phase-field models and numerical simulations to predict the effects of actin network elasticity, interfacial tension, and active stresses on material properties. Our theory will elucidate the coarsening mechanisms of viscous 2D droplets embedded within a viscoelastic heterogeneous network. By establishing new design principles for adaptive 2D materials, this project will advance soft matter physics, materials science, and biomaterials engineering. This project will also integrate education and research through structured science communication workshops that train students to effectively convey technical ideas to broad audiences. Additionally, outreach efforts will increase participation of students who will become future leaders of the STEM workforce. This work supports the National Science Foundation\u2019s mission by advancing fundamental research, promoting technological innovation, and strengthening the future STEM workforce through interdisciplinary training at the interface of physics, materials science, and engineering\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
